In this respect, our project is highly relevant, despite the fact that we mainly analyze historical sources through the lens of film, TV and literary narratives. Therefore, SNSF can only continue carefully to choose diverse projects in terms of theories, disciplines, research objectives and cultural/geohistorical contexts.","","When we started our HK project in 2004, Hong Kong was one of the most innovative urban communities. Despite still being under British colonial rule, the community thrived. Today, under PRC rulership, there is massive social unrest and insecurity, especially among the young population, about political participation, job opportunities and the future as a whole. To study the coming of age experience during the 1950s meant to us to understand how British colonial rule was gradually transformed into an accountable political system by the highly educated society. It seems that, with the Chinese decolonizers, HKers are led back to the ""roaring"" 1960s in some way or another. We did not expect this development and will carry on with our observation and analysis of cultural responses with regard to the special sociopolitical situation in HK.",NA,3057.42,23.38,NA,NA,NA,14.1,NA,59.97,NA,NA,NA,67.53,NA,NA,NA,63.44,NA,NA,NA,45.15,NA,NA,NA,113.12,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,89.96,NA,NA,2580.77,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Andrea","Riemenschnitter","andrea.riemenschnitter@aoi.uzh.ch",507754,"female",153590,"Coming of age in Hong Kong: a study of a colonial literary field in the 1950s","Other languages and literature","Project funding (Div.

It was nevertheless possible to form a postdoc who is now continuing working in science and a PhD student who brilliantly finished with a new topic.

Social innovation should be clearly stated in the broader impact section or in a dedicated section of SNSF proposals. This would both promote social innovation and make scientists more aware of various aspects of social innovation. In fact, most scientific projects promote social innovation even if scientists might not always be fully aware of it. This is a missed opportunity for both science and society. In order to inspire scientists to promote social innovation with their projects, various examples of social innovation could be illustrated on the SNSF website and various workshops and webinars could be organized with teams of experts. Social innovation should not be perceived by scientists as an obligation but as an opportunity and an added value. In fact, proposals should not be penalized if social innovation is not adequately addressed. However, in case of acceptance of the project, examples of social-innovation activities could be proposed to the PIs by a team of SNSF experts.","For both my two lines of research (dispersal and sedimentation of volcanic particles and assessment of volcanic risk) I found that operational agencies and decision makers were more inclined to implement scientific innovation in their policies if they were actively involved in project publication and/or organization of dedicated workshops instead of just being informed of the project results.
Local workshops also worked very well to engage with various local groups (e.g. general public, stake holders, decision makers). In fact, through these workshops various social groups felt more empowered and motivated to increase their preparedness to face natural hazards. 
","What I did not full expect from the social innovation of my projects is how the engagement we had at the local level (e.g. workshops, interviews, informal discussions) actually triggered spontaneous activities in the local community and favoured interaction amongst various social groups that otherwise would not have happened. 
I was also positively surprised by how international scientists that were invited to the local workshops could appreciate the importance of sharing project results with the local communities, which is not common practice in our scientific community.

This is due partly to the fact that the SNF project selected is related to a set of other research projects and surveys that we have been and are still currently conducting in the lab, and which pertain to the impact of sleep curtailment in various populations (from kids to adults) and caused by the use of smartphones etc. In addition, the selected project uncovers neuroscience mechanisms underlying memory consolidation occurring during sleep.

Whereas the results were promising (basically providing proof-of-concept) and the company was also interested, the second stage of the project (submitted with commitment from the company) did not receive funding from SNF. 

Whereas we still believe that this specific drug/drug target could bring a clinical benefit for this still poorly treatable disease entity, the small scale of the project and marginal financing led to delay in project completion (publication currently pending) and hindered its translation to societal impact.

We studied young adults affected by ADHD, a population that is often left away from the studies (that are mainly focused on children and adolescents). However, adults affected by ADHD might represent up to 5-8% of the population.  We show that a cognitive task called ""Dual n-back task"" has a reliable effect. The Dual n-back task in the adaptive mode offers as a promising candidate for a cognitive remediation of adult ADHD patients without pharmaceutical medication.

This research provides a narrative that exposes the very restricted view that most humans have of sexuality. While evolution has led to the emergence of two fundamental sexual strategies, namely making many small germ cells (the male sexual strategy) or making fewer large germ cells (the female sexual strategy), these do not always map onto (lifelong) male and female individuals. Instead, these fundamental strategies can be expressed by the same individual, either sequentially (in sex changing organisms) or at the same time (in simultaneous hermaphrodites). Our research has documented extensive quantitative variation in the amounts allocated to the male and female side of a simultaneous hermaphrodite, and identified important predictors of this variation.","It is fundamental research that has provided the basis for human development and advancement.

To introduce a form of SNSF award for the different groups and categories of researchers per year (even without any monetary expression) - just an honour and recognition. This will surely stimulate social innovation and awareness of society about these achievements.

I feel that often such projects, in order to really reach impact in the society, would benefit of further sponsoring continuity, 3-4 years being a too short term. In my research area, they also typically involve a lot of engineering (as opposed to research/science) and a stronger support of engineering staff would be welcome, of course in addition to the great one already made available by the SNSF for PhD students and postdoctoral fellows. This would certainly serve as great incentive to go after such projects which have, according to my experience, a lower scientific impact than their more fundamental research counterpart, especially when normalized with the overall effort invested in the project.

Finally, last but not least, I think SNSF surveys are great initiatives, but this period of the year is unavoidably overbooked and surveys of any type tend be put at the bottom of the list ... .
