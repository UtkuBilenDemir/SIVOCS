To address the unmet need we propose to develop a non-invasive bioluminescent (BL) method for evaluation of enzymatic activity and metabolite absorption in animal models of human disease. The methodology is based on bioluminescent imaging (BLI) that is widely used in the field of pre-clinical research to monitor tumor progression, metastasis and response to candidate therapeutics in animal models. The prototypical BLI experiment employs a luciferase enzyme as a reporter and enzymatic oxidation of its substrate luciferin is accompanied by photon emission. Importantly, BLI obviates several problems associated with fluorescence imaging, such as tissue-derived background signal, photobleaching, and inefficient probe excitation. Recent development of BLI probes to sense molecular signatures of target tissues relies on simple principle that luciferin 'caged' on the phenolic oxygen is not a substrate for luciferase unless it gets 'uncaged' by specific biological process of interest.  For example, several luciferin probes have been designed to sense enzymatic activities such as those of beta-galactosidase, caspases, beta-lactamases, and furin. Another set of probes allows quantification of hydrogen peroxide and fatty acid fluxes as well as protein-protein interactions.  However, despite its great sensitivity and ease of use, current BLI has serious limitations. First, it is only limited to the use in transgenic mice that genetically express luciferase enzyme either ubiquitously or in certain organs as well as animals transplanted with luciferase-expressing cells. Unfortunately, these represent only a small percentage of existing animal models of human disease. Secondly, all current technologies that allow sensing of bioluminescent signal are limited to the use in rodents (mice and rats). In the standard set-up of typical experiment the animals are placed into the 'black box' of IVIS camera (PerkinElmer, USA) and optical signal is detected using 'charged coupled device' (CCD). This represents another serious limitation for the use of this technology for drug development because a big fraction of in vivo tests are done on non-rodent animal models. Third, the animals must be anesthetized during the signal acquisition that drastically changes their metabolism and affects multiple biological processes in the body. This is the major reason why none of the current technologies have been adopted by pharmaceutical companies for the use in drug development research.Therefore, there is a pressing demand for more efficient in vivo models to evaluate enzymatic activities and metabolite absorption in live animals that currently do not exist. Since most of the enzymes are intracellular, they cannot be directly measured in blood, urine, or other bodily fluids. Thus, whole body monitoring of particular disease-related enzyme would require a substrate of this enzyme to be injected in order for it to be taken up by all cells of interest inside the organism, and enzymatically cleaved (metabolized). The resulting metabolite is further detected by blood/tissue sampling followed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LS/MS) analysis. This procedure is very labour-intensive because multiple blood/tissue manipulations steps are required to obtain the data. In addition, it is highly invasive for animals leading to big number being sacrificed in the course of one assay. This makes the current technology very expensive and not suitable for screening of large number of drug candidates and experimental conditions. The same thing is true for studies of metabolic fluxes where no real-time non-invasive methods currently exist for evaluation of these important biological processes.To address this unmet need for efficient in vivo models, we propose to develop a non-invasive bioluminescent (BL) method that should allow real-time longitudinal study using a highly sensitive sensor microsystem (SM) and Cell Encapsulation Device (CED). The new sensing technology has several advantages over existing methods. First, it will allow real-time non-invasive evaluation of enzymatic activity and metabolic fluxes and has the potential to become an important tool for drug discovery.  Second, since the method is based on highly sensitive imaging modality, it is expected to achieve better sensitivity in comparison to the one based on tissue/blood sampling. Another significant advantage of the new methodology is the ability to obtain kinetic longitudinal readout of enzymatic activity, without any need of tissue manipulation steps. Third, the new method aims to significantly reduce the number of animals because the technique is highly non-invasive and animals can be re-used used for other assays. In addition, the new sensing technology would reduce the work load associated with tissue manipulation steps therefore making this procedure a lot less expensive. Forth, it can be extended to studies of metabolite absorption in real-time non-invasive manner, for which not good methods exist. The new methodology will be immediately adapted for non-invasive evaluation of activities of enzymes for which suitable reagents described above already exist (ex. caspase 3/7, b-lactamase, b-galactosidase, fatty acid absorption, etc). In addition, we propose to expend the list of existing imaging reagents by making new probes for evaluation of activity of glucose transporters that play important role in many human diseases. Our preliminary data on some of the novel probes for studies of glucose uptake provide good foundation for their further investigation. This project aims to investigate the following main points:•Development of novel 'Cell Encapsulation Device' (CED) that would consist of polymeric 'hollow fiber' implanted with cells expressing luciferase reporter that will survive at high density for several weeks. Once the imaging reagent gets 'uncaged' by corresponding enzyme, the CED will produce light, proportional to the activity of the enzyme or flux of metabolite. •Development of a new sensor microsystem for detection of bioluminescent signal produced as the result of activity of certain enzyme and determination of optimal measurement parameters with this novel device.•Analysis of the microelectronics approach able to efficiently support performance of high accuracy detector.•Design of the microelectronic circuits and corresponding algorithm for cost-efficient ultra-high sensitivity device.•Bench-marking and validation of this new approach using existing enzymatic activity imaging reagents such as probes for measurements of caspase 3/7 or beta-galactosidase activity.•Extension of this novel sensing technology for imaging of metabolite absorption.

Ribosomes are composed of two subunits of distinct structure, size, composition and function. The human 80S ribosome, built by the small 40S and the large 60S subunit, is altogether 4.3 MDa in size and composed of 4 ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and about 80 ribosomal proteins (RPs). To be functional in protein translation, the ribosomal subunits must be correctly assembled, following a well-ordered pathway during which a long precursor rRNA (pre-rRNA) is processed, modified and folded and the RPs are placed at their designated positions. The synthesis of ribosomal subunits in eukaryotes proceeds along a complex assembly line starting with pre-rRNA synthesis in nucleoli, followed by many intermediate nuclear steps up to their final maturation in the cytoplasm. Proteomic approaches and genetic screens in yeast drove the identification of more than 250 trans-acting factors that assist ribosomal subunit production. These factors associate with pre-ribosomal particles either transiently or as structural components of precursor particles, and are continuously recycled to assist consecutive rounds of ribosome assembly. Although the basic aspects of ribosome biogenesis are conserved between yeast and man, our knowledge on the even more complex process of human ribosome biogenesis is far less complete. This increased complexity not only arises from the larger size of mammalian ribosomes and the more intricate pre-rRNA processing pathway, but also from the highly multifaceted regulatory networks and surveillance pathways linked to ribosome production in vertebrate cells. Since deregulation of ribosome biogenesis manifests in a variety of genetically inherited ribosomopathies and is associated with tumorigenesis, there is great demand to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the process in human cells. As defects in ribosome synthesis activate the p53 stress response pathway leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, factors involved in the making of ribosomes have emerged as attractive targets for cancer therapy.In this grant application, we propose to address some key, unresolved questions related to ribosome biogenesis. As a broad approach, we will further pursue imaging-based RNA interference screening campaigns to comprehensively identify factors involved in human ribosome synthesis. Here, we will give focus on the completion of a genome-wide RNAi screen on 60S subunit synthesis. In parallel, we will exploit data derived from a completed screen on 40S subunit synthesis to specifically address the function of a newly identified protein complex in early steps of pre-rRNA processing, and its role in governing p53 activation. Further, by exploiting the screening data, we will study the recycling of trans-acting factors as well as the role of selected factors in ribosome synthesis. Collectively, this research will not only provide a comprehensive analysis of the machinery involved in human ribosome synthesis, but will also advance the mechanistic understanding of key processes in the making of a fundamental macromolecular complex.",Institut für Biochemie Departement Biologie ETH Zürich,Zürich,116944,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",Australia,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

One major problem is that passaged adult chondrocytes used in this procedure have a reduced chondrogenic potential, which is not sufficiently rescued by the conventional, clinically approved scaffolds.  The goal of this project is the development of an advanced hydrogel/fiber composite with enhanced chondrogenic (Project A) and anti-inflammatory (Project B) properties.   Project A: Alginate sulfate is selected as the hydrogel component, as it mimics the high negative fixed charge density of the glycosaminoglycan-rich cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) and its growth factor binding affinity.   Poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) electrospun fibers are selected to mechanically reinforce the hydrogel and to elute chondro-inductive drugs.   We hypothesize that the combination of the sulfated hydrogel with the concomitant elution of a RhoA inhibitor will be sufficient to induce passaged human chondrocytes to fully assume a re-differentiated phenotype (Project A).  One of the further challenges facing tissue-engineered biomaterials is the need to survive in the demanding biological environment into which they are implanted.  Even so-called biocompatible materials can elicit unexpected host reactions when in contact with blood products and leucocytes, including high expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, induction of fibroproliferative phenotypes, increased matrix metalloprotease activity, and increased angiogenesis.    All of these factors can potentially interfere with the integration and regenerative potential of the biomaterial and hence its long-term fate in vivo.  The second project (Project B) therefore has as its goal to incorporate anti-inflammatory properties into the hydrogel/fiber composite.  We hypothesize that the alginate sulfate, due to its anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory properties, could push the polarization of top-seeded macrophages from an M1 phenotype to the more chondrogenic M2 phenotype. We further hypothesize that the anti-inflammatory properties can be enhanced through the sustained release of drugs like Celecoxib.  Both the optimized chondrogenic scaffold (Project A) and the anti-inflammatory scaffold (Project B) will be evaluated extensively in vitro and subsequently in in vivo using subcutaneous transplantation models.",Institute for Biomechanics ETH Zürich,Zürich,541659,0000-0002-8522-9909,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication;Research Infrastructures",Switzerland,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),An injectable heparin-conjugated hyaluronan scaffold for local delivery of transforming growth factor β1 promotes successful chondrogenesis,"Levinson Clara,  Lee Mihyun,  Applegate Lee Ann,  Zenobi-Wong Marcy",Published,2019,,10.1016/j.actbio.2019.09.017,https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/377534,Acta Biomaterialia,,Acta Biomaterialia,99,,168,180,Acta Biomaterialia,,Cartilage lacks basic repair mechanisms and thus surgical interventions are necessary to treat lesions. Minimally invasive arthroscopic procedures require the development of injectable biomaterials to support chondrogenesis of implanted cells. However most cartilage tissue engineering approaches rely on pre culture of scaffolds in media containing growth factors (GFs) such as transforming growth factor (TGF) β1 which are crucial for cartilage formation and homeostasis. GFs media supplementation is incompatible with injectable approaches and has led to a knowledge gap about optimal dose of GFs and release profiles needed to achieve chondrogenesis. This study aims to determine the optimal loading and release kinetics of TGF β1 bound to an engineered GAG hydrogel to promote optimal cartilaginous matrix production in absence of TGF β1 media supplementation. We show that heparin a GAG known to bind a wide range of GFs covalently conjugated to a hyaluronan hydrogel leads to a sustained release of TGF β1. Using this heparin conjugated hyaluronan hydrogel 0.25 to 50 ng TGF β1 per scaffold was loaded and cell viability proliferation and cartilaginous matrix deposition of the encapsulated chondroprogenitor cells were measured. Excellent chondrogenesis was found when 5 ng TGF β1 per scaffold and higher were used. We also demonstrate the necessity of a sustained release of TGF β1 as no matrix deposition is observed upon a burst release. In conclusion our biomaterial loaded with an optimal initial dose of 5 ng/scaffold TGF β1 is a promising injectable material for cartilage repair with potentially increased safety due to the low locally administered GF dose.,159783,"Media relations: print media, online media",Neue Waffe im Kampf gegen Arthrose?

In particular, repeated exposure to increased levels of progesterone in the context of the luteal phase of the menstrual cycles has emerged as an important factor in breast cancer risk. Progesterone acts on a subset of inner (luminal) mammary epithelial cells that express its cognate receptor. The hormone elicits cell intrinsic effects and induces the expression of paracrine factors, like wnt4 and RANKL, which act on different neighboring luminal and basal epithelial cells. How the hormone controls interactions of epithelial cells with the basal membrane and the stroma is still poorly understood. We have identified Adamts18, a poorly studied, secreted protease as an indirect target of progesterone action in basal mammary epithelial cells and propose that it provides an important link to progesterone -induced changes in the basal membrane which in turn impinge on stromal cells.To study Adamts18 in vivo function, we generated an Adamts18-/- mouse. Preliminary data indicate that ductal branching is delayed in Adamts18-/- mammary epithelia due to impaired stem cell function. We will test the hypothesis that Adamts18 is an important downstream mediator of progesterone receptor (PR)/wnt4 function in the mammary epithelium in vivo. We will characterize changes in the basal membrane composition that result from Adamts18 deletion and test the hypothesis that Adamts18-induced ECM modulation in turn impacts on signaling in fibroblasts and other stromal and epithelial cell types, important to stem cell function. We will test the hypothesis that Adamts18’s biological activity relates to its ability to process specific proteoglycans and attempt to identify its substrate(s).To dissect Adamts18 function, we will use genetic tools, viral gene modulation combined with tissue recombination techniques and intraductal injections as well as FACS sorting and proteomics. Our findings have implications for breast cancer prevention; the proposed PR/wnt4/Adamt18 axis activates stem cells and has pro-tumorigenic activity; it is of potential interest to inhibit it in premenopausal high-risk patients. While PR and wnt signaling are active in many tissues, Adamts18 appears to have a very limited, organ-specific function; this and its extracellular location make it an excellent target.",EPFL_FSV_ISREC,Lausanne,138974,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",Switzerland,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),The secreted protease Adamts18 links hormone action to activation of the mammary stem cell niche,"Ataca Dalya,  Aouad Patrick,  Constantin Céline,  Laszlo Csaba,  Beleut Manfred,  Shamseddin Marie,  Rajaram Renuga Devi,  Jeitziner Rachel,  Mead Timothy J.,  Caikovski Marian,  Bucher Philipp,  Ambrosini Giovanna,  Apte Suneel S.,  Brisken Cathrin",Published,2020,,10.1038/s41467-020-15357-y,http://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-15357-y,Nature Communications,,Nature Communications,11,1,1571,1571,Nature Communications,,Estrogens and progesterone control breast development and carcinogenesis via their cognate receptors expressed in a subset of luminal cells in the mammary epithelium. How they control the extracellular matrix important to breast physiology and tumorigenesis remains unclear. Here we report that both hormones induce the secreted protease Adamts18 in myoepithelial cells by controlling Wnt4 expression with consequent paracrine canonical Wnt signaling activation. Adamts18 is required for stem cell activation has multiple binding partners in the basement membrane and interacts genetically with the basal membrane specific proteoglycan Col18a1 pointing to the basement membrane as part of the stem cell niche. In vitro ADAMTS18 cleaves fibronectin; in vivo Adamts18 deletion causes increased collagen deposition during puberty which results in impaired Hippo signaling and reduced Fgfr2 expression both of which control stem cell function. Thus Adamts18 links luminal hormone receptor signaling to basement membrane remodeling and stem cell activation.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It occurs in a number of species across several orders of mammals. Diapause uncouples mating from delivery and allows birth to take place when the offspring has the best chance of survival. During diapause, the embryo is hosted in the uterus without placental supply until reactivation and implantation occur. The intrauterine environment, namely the histotroph, plays a crucial role in providing a milieu permissive to the needs of the embryo. It is here that embryonic and maternal secretions compile and signals can be intercepted. To date, neither the signals regulating entry into diapause nor the factors responsible for embryonic reactivation have been identified. This project aims at solving the unknown regulation of embryonic growth velocity. We hypothesize that while entry into diapause is inherent to the embryo, a maternally derived signal is needed for its reactivation. The roe deer is an ideal animal model since the condition of arrested development allows the investigation of three distinct phases: prior to diapause, during developmental arrest and after reactivation. We will combine complementary ex vivo field studies, in vitro cell culture and in vivo trials to address this research question. One specific focus is laid on the differentiation between maternal and embryonic signals leading to the reactivation of the embryo. Understanding of embryonic growth velocity may elucidate early discontinuous development as a trait common to all mammals.

Following exit from diapause the embryo rapidly elongates and subsequently implants. In diapausing carnivores and marsupials resumption of embryonic growth is regulated by ovarian steroid hormones. In the roe deer the role of steroid hormones is not known to date. In the present study progesterone (P4) estradiol 17β (E2) and total estrogens (Etot) were determined in blood plasma and endometrium of roe deer shot in the course of regular huntings between September and December. Steroid hormone concentrations were correlated to the corresponding size of the embryo derived from ex vivo uterine flushing and to the date of sampling. The mean plasma concentrations of P4 (5.4 ± 0.2 ng/ml mean ± SE N = 87) E2 (24.3 ± 2.6 pg/ml N = 86) and Etot (21.7 ± 2.6 pg/ml N = 78) remained constant over the sampling period and were not correlated to embryonic size. Likewise endometrial concentrations of P4 (66.1 ± 6.5 ng/ml) E2 (284.0 ± 24.43 pg/ml) and Etot (440.9 ± 24.43 pg/ml) showed no changes over time.

The low temperature limit differs between species and it restricts the region in which a crop can be grown. In the field, limiting cold temperatures are often only reached during a short period of the diel (24 h) cycle. It is unknown whether plants have different temperature requirements at different times throughout the diel cycle and also whether and how the genotype-specific temperature requirements change with development. Especially for crop plants, this is an important research area, which needs attention for improved crop performance under cold conditions. This would result in accelerated yield formation, thus minimizing losses conferred by summer drought and heat stress.

The aim of the proposed project is to assess the value of growth monitoring as a dynamic trait in limiting temperatures for physiological and breeding-related studies in winter wheat and soybean. These two species are globally important crops; they differ with respect to their low temperature sensitivity and their growth morphology.

This mutualism profoundly shapes many aspects of our biology. One such important aspect is juvenile growth, a complex process whose phenotypic outcome is entirely dependent on the intricate interplay between the genotype and the environment. During the juvenile growth phase, acute and chronic undernutrition leads to severe wasting, stunting and in extreme cases, childhood mortality. Survivors of childhood malnutrition suffer adversary health impact and long-term neurological and reproductive consequences. A few recent and noteworthy studies have established that the activities of the gut microbiome clearly play a paramount role in optimizing juvenile growth in different nutritional environment, but the molecular mechanism behind such host-microbiota mutualism is frankly missing. We have previously demonstrated that in the presence of nutritive stress, mono-associating the exaxenic Drosophila larvae with a natural fly gut commensal bacteria, Lactobacillus plantarum, can fully recapitulate the beneficial effect of an intact conventional microbiota by accelerating larval growth and maturation rate. Here we propose a joint effort between François Leulier's group (IGFL, Lyon, France) and Bart Deplancke's group (EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland) to couple functional studies to a systems genetics approach to uncover the variants and genetic architecture underlying the L.plantarum-mediated growth benefits, and to functionally characterize the molecular basis of the candidate genes associate with such causal variants. To do so, we will screen through the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), a collection of 205 fully sequenced and annotated fly strains that have been extensively inbred to homozygosity. The DGRP collection harbors a large amount of natural variants found in the wild and has been shown to be an excellent tool to study various complex traits. We conducted a pilot study of 54 DGRP lines and provide direct evidence that larval growth in the presence or absence of L.plantarum manifests large phenotypic range among the DGRP lines, which we hypothesize to be a complex trait controlled by natural variations at multiple interacting loci. We therefore propose to (1) extend the phenotypic study to the entire DGRP collection, (2) identify and functionally validate genetic variants associated to L.plantarum-mediated growth promotion among the DGRP lines, and (3) dissect at the system level the transcriptomic changes upon L.plantarum association and identify relevant eQTLs as part of the regulatory network controlling such transcriptomic changes. The results from this proposal will facilitate similar human association studies to discover genetic variants governing mutualism between the gut microbiota and its juvenile host, provide the intellectual framework for future host-microbiota interaction studies in vertebrate models, and hence promote innovative designs for personalized probiotic therapy.

For many of these meta-bolically “talented” producers, a significant genome portion is dedicated to natural product biosynthe-sis. In most habitats, however, readily culturable bacteria such as these comprise only a minute frac-tion of the total prokaryotic diversity. A fundamental knowledge gap therefore exists regarding the chemistry of 'microbial dark matter' and its utilization potential. The proposed project will directly address this gap by asking the following questions: How can we efficiently study the biosynthetic repertoire of uncultivated producers? What is their metabolic diversity? How can we access natural products generated by these elusive organisms? To explore these important questions in a targeted, systematic fashion, we will apply a hypothesis-driven strategy that combines chemistry, single-cell analysis, metagenomics, enzyme biochemistry, and synthetic biology. We will mainly focus on 'En-totheonella' bacteria, which are symbiotically associated with marine sponges. Previous studies iden-tified three members of this uncultivated candidate genus as a remarkably rich source of structurally unique and highly active compounds. We will perform comparative genomic analyses on a larger di-versity of 'Entotheonella' phylotypes to understand their specialized metabolism at broad scale. Addi-tional, non-'Entotheonella' producer groups identified in other projects will be integrated into this study and subjected to similar analyses. The in silico data will be complemented by functional exper-iments, in which we will analyze biosynthetic pathways at the enzymatic and chemical level. A third line of research will investigate strategies to provide renewable sources for 'Entotheonella'-derived com-pounds. We expect that this multidisciplinary project will open new avenues for drug discovery and for assigning function to the vast microbial space with unknown properties, with implications for areas ranging from basic microbiology to pharmaceutical applications.",Institut für Mikrobiologie Departement Biologie ETH Zürich,Zürich,611982,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication;Exchange of personnel",United States of America,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,165695,"Media relations: radio, television",Antibiotika: Kampf gegen Killerkeime,https://www.srf.ch/play/tv/einstein/video/antibiotika-kampf-gegen-killerkeime?id=1da4feea-a2bd-48f4-b538-49d9690fa329&startTime=1536,2020

This proposal focuses on two of these processes: splicing regulation and translation regulation. Gene regulation plays a major role in many diverse cellular processes such as embryonic development, cell differentiation and synapse activation. We focus here on aspects of gene regulation that are under the control of RNA binding proteins (RBP). Regarding splicing regulation, we are focusing our attention to how the U1snRNP interact with various alternative-splicing factors like SR proteins or hnRNP proteins or how hnRNP A1 multimerize to repress splicing. Regarding translation regulation our main efforts are with three RBPs, PTB, dnd1 and the bacterial protein RsmE. Finally, more generally, we would aim at fully understanding the RRM-RNA code of recognition and also how motions can influence RNA binding recognition with examples of allosteric anti-cooperativity. To achieve these aims, we will combine experimental and computational approaches to achieve this goal.We will use hybrid approaches that combine NMR with EPR, SAXS and possibly EM.

Up to now functional assessment and risk assessment is mostly based on measurements of either blood flow velocity or pressure, which rely on several assumptions and are subject to significant uncertainty. In this project we want to move past approximate measurements and establish phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a method for accurate stenosis characterization. In clinical routine, pressure gradients and effective orifice area are used as measures of aortic stenosis severity. A common method is to measure the pressure loss via a catheter. However, this method is invasive and it provides only limited information on stenosis characteristics that is often insufficient e.g. for the planning of clinical intervention. Doppler echocardiography is the standard tool to assess the severity of a stenosis. It has, however, been noted that it is affected by significant uncertainty due to technical and conceptual limitations of Doppler echo, i.e. the assumption of laminar flow with flat velocity profiles at the vena contracta, difficulties in the alignment of Doppler and blood flow intercept angle and the inability of assessing pressure recovery. Therefore, there is a need for establishing alternative non-invasive methods capable of providing more complete and accurate information on stenosis severity. The applicants have proven recently that MRI can measure space and time resolved flow velocities and turbulent kinetic energy with good accuracy by validating it against particle tracking velocimetry in vitro. This was an important first step to show the adequacy of MRI for evaluating pathological aortic flow. The objective of the present follow-up project is to assess the ability of the method to quantify the severity of a stenosis by assessing energy loss and pressure recovery.Research PlanIt is the aim of this proposal to perform a detailed validation of the assessment of energy loss and pressure recovery from MRI by validating it against computational fluid dynamics (CFD), particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) and pressure wire recordings. We will systematically test different types and degrees of stenosis and evaluate energy loss and related key quantities such as pressure recovery and regurgitation. Measurements will be performed in vitro in a patient-specific aortic cast under realistic flow conditions using MRI and PTV for varying degrees of stenosis and different stenosis shapes. In a first step we will consider a rigid model where selected cases will be studied in silico using CFD to complement the experimental measurements which are affected by noise and limited spatial resolution. In a second step we will use MRI and PTV to investigate energy efficiency in a flexible phantom. The project encompasses three work packages:I.System characterization and reference measurements focusing on:•PC-MRI measurements in vivo to obtain geometry and flow in the aorta of a control and a stenosis patient•Iterative adaptation of realistic boundary conditions into the aortic phantom•Reference measurements in phantom using PTV and MRI under physiological conditions•Generation of unstructured mesh of healthy and stenosed geometries for CFD simulationsII.Investigation of stenosis severity for rigid model including:•Data acquisition of MRI, CFD and 3D-PTV data in a circular stenosis phantom•Measurement of TKE and its transport (production and dissipation)•Evaluate new parameterization of stenosis severity  based on measured TKEIII.Investigation of stenosis severity for flexible model including:•Data acquisition of MRI and 3D-PTV for different stenosis shapes e.g. tricuspid, circular, triangular•Measurement of TKE balance for different stenosis shapes and area ratio (severity), evaluate energy losses and  transient effects  (e.g. regurgitation)•Validate new parameterization of stenosis severity  based on TKESignificanceBiomedical imaging is increasingly emerging as a basic clinical investigational tool and with this interdisciplinary research we want to establish MRI as a method for accurate stenosis assessment. The project strives to produce both significant scientific output and clinical advances. In this project we expect to develop a relation between TKE and energy loss through viscous dissipation of TKE measured through MRI. After completion of this project we also expect to better understand the relation between valve characteristics, such as geometry and effective orifice area, and energy loss and pressure recovery. The potential impact of this study is manifold including characterization and monitoring of changes in blood transport efficiency associated with onset of vascular and valvular diseases and progression thereof.","Eidgenössische Forschungsanstalt WSL für Wald, Schnee und Landschaft",Birmensdorf ZH,547294,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication;Research Infrastructures",Switzerland,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),Shear-scaling-based approach for irreversible energy loss estimation in stenotic aortic flow – An in vitro study,"Gülan Utku,  Binter Christian,  Kozerke Sebastian,  Holzner Markus",Published,2017,,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2017.03.006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021929017301495,Journal of Biomechanics,,Journal of Biomechanics,56,,89,96,Journal of Biomechanics,,,159686,"Media relations: print media, online media",Vortices in the bloodstream help us to understand aneurysms,https://www.horizons-mag.ch/2018/09/06/vortices-in-the-bloodstream-help-us-to-understand-aneurysms/,2018

Many more are put into uselessly deep or prolonged chemical coma. Proper anesthesia requires the achievement of a certain target plasma concentration of the drugs (e.g. propofol, fentanyl or midazolam, etc.). Today, such drugs are regularly injected by Target Controlled Infusion (TCI) systems, while the usual magnitude of prediction errors in control models reaches 20-30% due to the patients’ diversity. Therefore, continuous monitoring of anesthetic agents circulating in body fluids would contribute to better individualization of patients’ management. Project Focus: We propose to create a system with a semi-closed-loop control for anesthesia delivery based on the anesthetics monitoring in human fluids. Core of the system will include several electrochemical sensors for the real-time monitoring of anesthetics and sedatives, and complementary intelligent decision-making algorithms able to adjust dosages and delivery rates according to the sensor measurements, under the ultimate control of anesthesiologists.Expected outcome: We aim to produce a prototype of a device implementing semi-closed-loop anesthesia delivery based on real-time measurements of anesthetics concentration. The prototype will be ready for clinical development, after appropriate animal testing.Methods: the proposed semi-closed loop prototype is logically divided into four parts, all addressed by the activities of the present project. Part I (responsible Main Applicant: S. Carrara)It develops the setup emulating changes of drugs concentration in patients’ fluids (e.g., plasma concentration) and the array of sensors (S1, S2...

Although the majority of ALS cases (>90%) are considered to be sporadic, the identification of genetic factors associated with familial forms has largely contributed to our understanding of pathogenesis. In particular, animal and cellular models have been generated based on missense mutations in the SOD1 gene linked to autosomal dominant inheritance of the disease. Exploring the etiology of ALS in SOD1 models has revealed a complex array of cellular dysfunctions collectively leading to muscle denervation and motoneuron death as a function of intrinsic cellular vulnerability. These models have also highlighted the important contribution of non cell-autonomous mechanisms. In particular, astrocytes have been implicated in ALS progression. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenic interaction between astrocytes and motoneurons have remained elusive.Our objective is to further decipher the pathologic interaction between astrocytes and motoneurons in the perspective of developing therapies for ALS. Towards this goal, this project brings together three expert teams in motoneuron diseases, in order to provide complementary technologies applicable to animal and cellular models of ALS, such as gene transfer to the brain and spinal cord and genome-wide analysis of gene expression. The research project is articulated in three main workpackages, with the following specific aims:1. Identify the non cell-autonomous signals derived from of astrocytes that affect motoneuron susceptibility to disease and motoneuron regenerative programs in SOD1 ALS.2. Elucidate how diseased motoneurons affect neighboring astrocytes in SOD1 ALS.3. Determine the effects of the identified target genes and pathways on the ALS pathology and design novel therapeutic approaches to achieve neuroprotection and improve neuromuscular function in ALS.To achieve these objectives, we will take advantage of gene delivery to either motoneurons or astrocytes in mouse spinal cord using adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors, to locally and selectively silence the expression of mutated human SOD1 in a given cell type. The non-cell-autonomous effects of suppressing mutated SOD1 in astrocytes will be determined by measuring the gene expression changes in the neighboring motoneurons. Conversely, we will assess how SOD1 silencing in motoneurons affects gene expression in astrocytes.This experimental framework will provide the base for the rationale identification and validation of key pathways involved in the pathologic interaction between astrocytes and motoneurons in the SOD1 pathology. Comprehensive gene expression data sets related to the motoneuron-astrocyte axis will be made accessible to the ALS scientific community. We will further explore the therapeutic potential of the main target genes and determine if the identified targets are also relevant to other forms of ALS.",Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne Unité du Prof. Patrick AEBISCHER,Lausanne,43394,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results",Switzerland,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),Altered interplay between endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria in Charcot–Marie–Tooth type 2A neuropathy,"Bernard-Marissal Nathalie,  van Hameren Gerben,  Juneja Manisha,  Pellegrino Christophe,  Louhivuori Lauri,  Bartesaghi Luca,  Rochat Cylia,  El Mansour Omar,  Médard Jean-Jacques,  Croisier Marie,  Maclachlan Catherine,  Poirot Olivier,  Uhlén Per,  Timmerman Vincent,  Tricaud Nicolas,  Schneider Bernard L.,  Chrast Roman",Published,2019,,10.1073/pnas.1810932116,,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,116,6,2328,2337,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,,Mutations in the MFN2 gene encoding Mitofusin 2 lead to the development of Charcot–Marie–Tooth type 2A (CMT2A) a dominant axonal form of peripheral neuropathy. Mitofusin 2 is localized at both the outer membrane of mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum and is particularly enriched at specialized contact regions known as mitochondria associated membranes (MAM). We observed that expression of MFN2 R94Q induces distal axonal degeneration in the absence of overt neuronal death. The presence of mutant protein leads to reduction in endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria contacts in CMT2A patient derived fibroblasts in primary neurons and in vivo in motoneurons of a mouse model of CMT2A. These changes are concomitant with endoplasmic reticulum stress calcium handling defects and changes in the geometry and axonal transport of mitochondria. Importantly pharmacological treatments reinforcing endoplasmic reticulum–mitochondria cross talk or reducing endoplasmic reticulum stress restore the mitochondria morphology and prevent axonal degeneration. These results highlight defects in MAM as a cellular mechanism contributing to CMT2A pathology mediated by mutated MFN2.,156460,Talks/events/exhibitions,Jounées téléthon - Maladies Neurodégénératives et Myopathies,,2018

Species do not exist independent from each other, but interact in the form of ecological networks, which influences how species respond to those changes. Hence, global changes are expected to modify the structure of ecological networks, but a lack of understanding of the shaping of networks in the landscape impairs our ability to forecast future changes. The goal of the project is to better understand the spatial variation in the structure of plant-herbivore-parasitoid networks to forecast the likely consequences of global changes on biodiversity. We will answer the following questions. 1. How does the structure of networks vary spatially along environmental gradients? 2. What are the expected consequences of climate and land use changes on the future structure of networks and biodiversity? A large field survey will be conducted throughout Switzerland to sample interaction networks along elevation gradients. Barcoding coupled with next generation sequencing will be used to unravel the full interaction networks between plants, insects and parasitoids. Ecological network and species distribution modelling tools will allow unravelling the ecological assembly of networks and forecast how they will be impacted by global changes.

Although cellular metabolism is widely accepted to impact cellular function in health and disease and changes in cellular metabolism are tightly linked to the development of diseases such as cancer, rather little is known on how cellular metabolism regulates nutrient sensitive signaling pathways to promote cell growth. Using S.cerevisiae to study mechanisms of nutrient sensing, I have recently identified cytosolic pH as a critical cellular signal that regulates cell growth in response to carbon source supply by promoting both TORC1 and Ras activity upstream of PKA. Interestingly, increased cytosolic pH has previously been linked to enhanced cell growth in mammals and is considered as one of the hall-marks in cancer cells, suggesting that cytosolic pH might be conserved regulator of cell growth in response to environmental conditions.Therefore, I propose to comprehensively study the function of cytosolic pH in the regulation of cell growth in mammalian cells. Based on my own preliminary data, suggesting that upregulation of cytosolic pH upon growth factor stimulation is critical for cell growth and proliferation, my group will study the interplay between growth factor signaling and cytosolic pH in the regulation of cell growth. In particular, we aim to characterize the molecular mechanisms of the regulation of cytosolic pH by growth factors and identify pH sensitive signaling pathways mediating the regulation of cell growth under these conditions. In addition, we will establish a number of tools to measure and specifically manipulate cytosolic pH. Using these tools, we will identify environmental conditions affecting cytosolic pH and its contribution on the activity of key cellular signaling pathways using quantitative microscopy.Taken together, I am convinced that these studies will not only lead to a better understanding of the regulation of cell growth in mammalian cells, but should also help to clarify a longstanding question in tumor cell biology, namely, if changes in cytosolic pH might indeed contribute to the disease, or rather are a secondary consequence of cellular transformation.",Institut für Biochemie Departement Biologie ETH Zürich,Zürich,609649,0000-0002-4094-4773,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication;Research Infrastructures",Switzerland,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Recent molecular techniques uncovered a tremendous bacterial diversity in soil, however, the underlying mechanisms controlling composition, functioning and maintenance of diverse microbial communities remain largely unknown. In this proposal we aim to link dynamics of soil hydration conditions and nutrient availability in model soil systems with variations in microbial community composition. Understanding factors that shape species abundance is essential to gaining insights into how microbial communities assemble and function under the ever-changing aqueous habitats in soil. The research plan aims to expand ongoing research that has established a unique experimental system for systematic community level observations of a designed a synthetic microbial community combined with a microfluidic quantitative PCR assay designed for absolute quantification of species level changes in community composition. We first assembled a representative soil bacterial community comprised of 11 well-characterized bacterial species spanning a wide range of soil phyla. The community was inoculated onto model porous surfaces mimicking soil habitats with accurate control of hydration status. The activity and composition of the bacterial community established in a sand layer within each microcosm were evaluated using 16S fingerprinting and quantitative PCR. Preliminary results show that the bacterial assembly inoculated at equal proportions of species responds to hydration conditions, with saturated habitats enhancing competition for resources, while unsaturated conditions enhance niche formation that promote coexistence and diversity. The observed shifts in community composition can also be linked to physiological factors such as bacterial cell shapes, motility and their metabolic rate under given conditions. The trends deduced from experiments with the synthetic community under a range of controlled physico-chemical conditions contribute to basic understanding of how diversity is maintained in natural systems. Observations how the community stabilizes during the first hours of the experiment raises the question how the spatial structure of a given environment acts on the bacterial consortium and how extreme hydration conditions (saturated and very dry) would shape community composition and dynamics. To address these questions, two follow-up experiments are planned with the same soil bacterial community subjected to extreme dry conditions in a sand microcosms with defined hydration to answer the question how the consortia responds to extreme dry conditions and as second habitat microcosms with-agar surface as a set-up presenting routine laboratory conditions, the wet scenario. The hypothesis is that a representative soil bacterial community requires a heterogeneous, structured environment to maintain coexistence of dominant and rare species, whereas using standard habitats such as growing cells on an agar surface might select for more competitive species, while less competitive species would decline and eventually disappear. Such insights would enhance our understanding of soil ecological functioning and dominant species under different hydration states, and the mechanisms that maintain high level of biodiversity in soil.",Institut für Biogeochemie und Schadstoffdynamik ETH Zürich,Zürich,527990,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our previous SNF project allowed us to elucidate the genetic architecture of several quantitative traits that are relevant for both agriculture and fungal biology, including virulence, fungicide resistance, intrinsic growth rate, sporulation and thermal adaptation. We also identified several candidate genes that may contribute to these quantitative traits.  The next step, presented in this project proposal, is to functionally validate several of these candidate genes using techniques of molecular biology, including transformation, knockouts, homologous gene replacement and over-expression.  We also propose to extend the QTL analyses of our existing crosses to include several new traits that were not assayed in the original project, with an emphasis on growth rate in response to various environmental stresses, including extreme temperatures. The ability to identify and characterize the actual genes and associated functions underlying quantitative virulence and fungicide resistance will provide new knowledge that may eventually be useful for breeding resistant crops and for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries that produce fungicides, in addition to providing a better understanding of the molecular basis of quantitative characters.  Finally, we propose to follow up on the serendipitous discovery of a novel chromosome that emerged as a result of a fusion of sister chromatids in one of the parents used for QTL mapping.

In regard to PanNET, under the auspices of an SNSF grant, we extended our previous observations (Olson et al. 2009), and discovered molecular subtypes with distinctive metabolic, developmental, and metastatic phenotypes (Sadanandam et al. 2015). Both in human and mouse, we identified two common subtypes: insulinoma/islet tumors (IT), which are non-invasive and poorly metastatic, and a second subtype, which is more invasive and associated with metastasis, and therefore referred to as a “met-like primary (MLP)” tumor. In the course of profiling the transcriptomes of both mouse and human PanNET, we became intrigued by the distinctive microRNA (miR) signatures associated with the hallmark capability for invasion and metastasis. Given the opportunity presented by the SNF BoE award, we made the strategic decision to seed a new spin-off project aimed at functional analysis of miRs implicated in invasion and metastasis. We characterized six miRs that were found to be upregulated both in mouse and human MLP tumors compared to the rarely metastatic IT. We demonstrated that two miRs (miR-137, miR-132) could promote invasiveness when upregulated, whereas a different set of miRs (miR-23b, miR-27b, and miR-24-1) were able to augment distant metastasis of PanNET. In this new SNSF proposal, we intend to continue this line of investigation, seeking to identify and functionally validate additional miRs involved in orchestrating the metastasis of PanNET, and to reveal the gene targets for all such functionally involved miRs, as well as the cellular networks they alter in order to elicit their pro-invasive and pro-metastatic effects.  A major goal will be to determine whether miRs are involved in the colonization of macro-metastatic tumors, given that none of the five miRs identified and functionally assessed under the auspices of the BoE have colonizing activity.The search for new miRs involved in the metastasis cascade will leverage three distinctive mouse models of PanNET, and cross-filtering of their transcriptome and proteome profiles with those of human primary and metastatic PanNET. In addition to the prototypical RIP1-Tag2 (RT2) transgenic mouse model, inbred into the C57Bl/6J genetic background, which is rarely metastatic, we will incorporate two variations that are highly metastatic. Both involve the same RT2 transgene, but in one case carrying a conditional, tissue-specific gene knockout of the E-cadherin gene (which otherwise suppresses invasion and metastasis), and in the other being inbred into a distinct genetic background, A/J; in both cases, multi-focal liver metastasis occurs in virtually every tumor-bearing mouse. Three new candidates - not yet functionally validated - have been identified in preliminary profiling of the highly metastatic PanNET A/J model in concordance with metastatic human PanNET; these will follow the analytic path used for the initial 6 candidates, further establishing the technical basis for functionally assessing metastasis-modulating miRs using a medium-throughput approach.Finally, during the course of this new SNSF we will profile miR transcriptomes, as well as mRNA transcriptomes and proteomes in primary and metastatic samples of mouse SCLC, the major neuroendocrine cancer. We predict that a set of miRs and the pathways they modulate will prove be common between the two NETs, a hypothesis we will assess by integrating and cross-filtering the various ‘omic analyses. Together, the PanNET and SCLC miR transcriptome studies are expected to identify functionally important miRs that we will further characterize for their roles during invasion and metastasis of NETs. In sum, completion of the proposed goals will advance our knowledge about the roles of miRs in orchestrating the malignant phenotypes of PanNET and SCLC, and begin to lay a foundation for future pre-/co-clinical trials aiming to impede the invasive and metastatic capabilities of aggressive forms of NET.",Institut Suisse de Recherche Expérimentale sur le Cancer EPFL - SV - ISREC,Lausanne,94342,0000-0002-0883-5251,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Research Infrastructures",Spain,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The core components of telomeres are repetitive DNA sequences, telomere-specific multiprotein complexes and long noncoding RNAs including TERRA. TERRA is transcribed from telomeric repeats by RNA polymerase II and remains tightly associated to telomeric heterochromatin post-transcriptionally. Mounting evidence indicates that TERRA and telomere transcription are essential to support proper telomeric functions. On the other side, dysfunctions in TERRA production or chromatin association lead to severe telomere instability. We have recently established cellular systems in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe where transcription of one specific telomere (tiTEL) can be induced experimentally. Using this system, we have discovered that TERRA promotes telomere lengthening by activating or recruiting the specialized reverse transcriptase telomerase in cis. Moreover, we have recently reported that TERRA forms RNA:DNA hybrid structures with the telomeric DNA and improper resolution of these hybrids impairs telomere replication. Unpublished in vitro and in vivo evidence revealed that TRF1 and TRF2, two major telomere-associated proteins, regulate telomeric hybrid formation in cells thereby promoting telomere integrity and preventing cellular senescence. Finally, we have recently shown that telomeric hybrids are essential for telomere maintenance in a specific set of human cancer cells that elongate their telomeres through homologous recombination rather than telomerase activity (ALT cells). ALT is activated in a number of aggressive human cancers including juvenile osteosarcomas. We have also shown that the RNA endonuclease RNaseH1 is specifically recruited to ALT telomeres and promotes telomere maintenance through regulation of telomeric hybrid levels and homologous recombination.The main goal of this project proposal is to understand how TERRA and telomere transcription promote telomere maintenance in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and human cells through telomerase or homologous recombination. Moreover, by dissecting how TERRA, telomeric hybrids, RNAseH1 and telomeric proteins interplay in different cellular contexts, we aim at shading light on the intriguing connection between TERRA, cancer cell proliferation and cellular senescence.The project is articulated in 4 subprojects:Subproject 1: TERRA and telomerase recruitment/activation in fission yeast. By exploiting our S. pombe tiTEL strains, we will dissect the molecular mechanisms allowing TERRA to promote telomerase-mediated telomere elongation.Subproject 2: Functions of TRF1 and TRF2 in regulating telomeric hybrids. We will study how TRF1 and TRF2 functionally interact in order to regulate telomeric RNA:DNA hybrids in human cells and how improper resolution of these structures leads to telomere instability and cellular senescence.Subproject 3: RNaseH1 and telomeric hybrids at ALT telomeres. We will study the molecular mechanisms that allow specific recruitment/retention of RNAseH1 at ALT telomeres and how RNaseH1 regulates telomeric hybrid formation in ALT, thereby assuring telomere length maintenance.Subproject 4: Halting ALT progression through modulation of RNaseH1. By using tissue-cultured cells, we will determine whether and how modulating endogenous RNaseH1 levels affects ALT cancer cell proliferation. We are also establishing collaborations with different groups with experience in synthetic drug development and mouse xenograft models in order to test whether altering RNaseH1 activity in human ALT cells has the potential to become an effective therapeutic approach to halt ALT tumor progression and metastasization.Our research should reveal novel cellular pathways connected to TERRA and telomere transcription employed by cells to maintain telomere length and integrity and therefore normal cell physiology. Moreover, our studies on ALT cancer cell proliferation in culture and in mice has the actual potential to identify new drugs for curing. We expect that the results that we will achieve by completing the research described in this project proposal will help to clarify the roles and regulation not only of TERRA but also of a variety of nuclear long noncoding RNAs in complex biological contexts such as modulation of transcription, heterochromatin formation and genome plasticity.",Institute of Molecular Medicine Faculty of Medicine University of Lisboa,Lisbon,139393,0000-0002-9396-1980,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",United States of America,Peer-reviewed,,Non-targeted metabolomic approach reveals two distinct types of metabolic responses to telomerase dysfunction in S. cerevisiae,"Buettner F.,  Jay K.,  Wischnewski H.,  Stadelmann T.,  Saad S.,  Jefimovs K.,  Mansurova M.,  Gerez J.,  Azzalin C.M.,  Dechant R.,  Ibáñez A.J.",Published,2017,,10.1007/s11306-017-1195-x,,Metabolomics,,Metabolomics,13,5,,,Metabolomics,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

RNAi has also formed the basis of an increasing number of synthetic gene circuits, whose applications range from basic biological research to biomedicine. Yet despite enormous progress in our understanding and utilization of RNAi pathway, surprisingly little is known about fine-grained quantitative parameters of this process. For example, a question such as 'What is the expected gene knockdown by a specific concentration of a certain microRNA molecule, given the sequence of a microRNA target in this gene's 3'-UTR?' cannot be answered using current knowledge. We contend that measuring and understanding these parameters is key to future advances of basic and applied exploration of RNA interference. This proposal described a series of experiments whose collective aim is to elucidate quantitative features of RNAi in mammalian cells on a population and single-cell level. The key experimental goal is to link the amount of intracellular microRNA molecules, measured in absolute units, to the observed degree of target gene knockdown under different conditions. The experimental variables include the sequence of a microRNA itself, sequence of the microRNA target (ranging from partial to full complementarity and varying the number of target repeats), and the cell type in which the knockdown takes place. Quantitative data will form the basis of a computational model that will recapitulate RNAi pathway with unprecedented degree of precision, capturing both average features and cell-to-cell heterogeneity ('noise'). Ultimately, the data in combination with the model will allow the construction of 'universal' genetic microRNA sensors capable of reporting absolute intracellular microRNA levels based on fluorescent readouts. Such easy-to-use, high-throughput sensors will be of immediate importance in both basic biological studies and as a diagnostic tool in the clinic.",Departement für Biosysteme und Ingenieurwissenschaften ETH Zürich,Basel,591343,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results",United States of America,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),Synthetic control systems for high performance gene expression in mammalian cells,"LillacciGabriele,  BenensonYaakov,  KhammashMustafa",Published,2018,,,https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/46/18/9855/5091958,Nucleic Acids Research,,Nucleic Acids Research,46,18,9855,9863,Nucleic Acids Research,,Tunable induction of gene expression is an essential tool in biology and biotechnology. In spite of that current induction systems often exhibit unpredictable behavior and performance shortcomings including high sensitivity to transactivator dosage and plasmid take up variation and excessive consumption of cellular resources. To mitigate these limitations we introduce here a novel family of gene expression control systems of varying complexity with significantly enhanced performance. These include: (i) an incoherent feedforward circuit that exhibits output tunability and robustness to plasmid take up variation; (ii) a negative feedback circuit that reduces burden and provides robustness to transactivator dosage variability; and (iii) a new hybrid circuit integrating negative feedback and incoherent feedforward that combines the benefits of both. As with endogenous circuits the complexity of our genetic controllers is not gratuitous but is the necessary outcome of more stringent performance requirements. We demonstrate the benefits of these controllers in two applications. In a culture of CHO cells for protein manufacturing the circuits result in up to a 2.6 fold yield improvement over a standard system. In human induced pluripotent stem cells they enable precisely regulated expression of an otherwise poorly tolerated gene of interest resulting in a significant increase in the viability of the transfected cells.,149802,Start-up,Pattern BioSciences,,2018

In Central Europe, the summer temperature is expected to increase by additional 1.9 - 7.0°C, and the amount of summer precipitation to decrease by 9 - 41% until 2070 (Schär et al. 2004), leading to more frequent drought events. Drought stress considerably affects physiological and biochemical processes of trees (Bray 1997; Körner 2000; Li et al. 2006b; Li et al. 2013), decreases the tree vigor (Martínez-Vilalta and Pinol, 2002) and forest growth and productivity (Bigler et al., 2006; Ciais et al., 2005; Sanchez-Salguero et al., 2012a; Sanchez-Salguero et al., 2012b), increases the tree mortality (Allen et al., 2010; Rebetez and Dobbertin, 2004; Vila-Cabrera et al., 2011), and changes the forest ecosystem functioning.         Physiological mechanisms underlying drought-induced growth decline and mortality of forests have been extensively studied (recently reviewed by Allen et al. 2010), and are currently being intensively debated, in particular in respect to hydraulic failure and carbon limitations determining the growth decline and mortality (McDowell et al. 2008; Adams et al. 2009; Leuzinger et al. 2009; Sala 2009; Delzon et al. 2010; McDowell and Sevanto 2010; Sala et al. 2010). This currently active debate indicates that the “physiological mechanisms of drought-induced tree mortality are far from being resolved” (Sala et al. 2010). Except for those two mainly discussed aspects, less attention has been paid to nutrient uptake that is also affected by drought and further influences the process of carbon gain (Gessler et al. 2005; Rennenberg et al. 2006). The interface between water and carbon balance with nutrient relations might, therefore, play a more important role for the impairment of trees under water restriction than previously assumed (Kreuzwieser and Gessler 2010).        To discuss the carbon source or sink limitation hypothesis, most previous studies investigated the carbon balance during the growing season only. They, indeed, ignored both the effects of drought-induced changes in nutrient availability on non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) and the NSC dynamics, in particular the winter NSC storage which affects the early spring regrowth. Hence, our proposed study will analyze the growth and dynamics (summer, winter) of carbon and nutrients in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) growing in a controlled, large-scale (1.2 ha, 800 trees with ~100-yrs-old), long-term (12 years) field irrigation experiment, and in a fully-controlled laboratory experiment with 10-15-yr-old trees (384 trees) treated by water availability (main-plot factor), fertilizer (sub-plot factor) and defoliation (sub-sub-plot factor) in a split-plot design. We aim to answer the questions of: (1) whether (drought-)stressed trees have a mechanism to maintain a minimum level of NSC for their vital functions; (2) whether and to what extent the stored NSC reserve can be remobilized to support growth; and (3) whether the well-documented growth decline of (drought-)stressed trees is mainly resulted from a decline in early spring regrowth caused by a limited NSC storage.       The proposed project will significantly contribute (1) to the controversial debate about whether drought may cause acute tree decline and mortality via carbon starvation, (2) to better understanding the long-term effects of low water availability on the supply of the mobile carbohydrates in relation to nutrient availability, (3) to identifying the key mechanisms of nutrient-coupled NSC production and supply underlying the stress-induced growth decline and mortality of trees, and (4) to ecophysiological basis for forest ecosystem management in a changing world.",Swiss Federal Research Inst.

The interactions between integrins are believed to be responsible for two major functions of cell adhesion sites: first, their role as a ‘scaffold’ in supporting the physical integration of the cell to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the cytoskeleton, which leads to the assembly of tissues with a particular morphological and mechanical properties; second, their ‘signaling’ activity, which enables cells to sense the chemical and mechanical properties of the external environment and to respond by activating signaling networks that regulate cell structure, dynamics, behavior and fate. Mammalian cells usually co-express several integrins, which recognize ECM components by binding short and specific amino acid stretches such as the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif. From the family of integrins, a5ß1 and all av-class integrins recognize and bind the RGD motif, which is found in a multitude of ECM proteins including fibronectin. However, although a5ß1 and avß3 integrins have distinct functions in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, the cooperation of both integrins in facilitating cell adhesion to ECM proteins exposing the RGD motif is not yet understood. In collaboration with Dr. Reinhard Fässler (MPI, Martinsried), we started to discern the distinct roles of two fibronectin binding integrins, avß3 and a5ß1 in fibroblast adhesion. Therefore, Fässler provided genetically engineered mouse kidney fibroblasts that express avß3 and/or a5ß1 integrins as fibronectin binding cell adhesion molecules. We found that integrin- fibronectin interaction in early fibroblast adhesion (=2 min) depends strongly on the specific set of integrins expressed. In fibroblasts expressing both heterodimers, cell adhesion was lower than for cells expressing only a5ß1 implicating a negative regulation. Thus, we observed the cross-regulation of a5ß1 and avß3 integrins. Surprisingly, we found that the activation and the subsequent signaling of avß3 integrins increase the adhesion of fibroblasts to fibronectin via a5ß1 integrins. This indicates a clear crosstalk between a5ß1 and avß3 integrins. Furthermore, it has been shown that the functional synergy between a5ß1 and av-class integrin signaling hubs is required to establish focal-adhesion-mediated rigidity sensing which play an avid role in mechanotransduction and migratory processes. Yet, it remains unexplained how a5ß1 and avß3 integrins are involved in regulating fibroblast adhesion. We will thus utilize single-cell force spectroscopy (SCFS) in combination with modern optical microscopy (e.g. TIRF, fluorescence, confocal) and atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based methods to quantitatively investigate pertinent aspects of cell adhesion, including integrin crosstalk, shear dependent adhesion, integrin localization and catch bond behavior of integrins. Therefore, we will closely work with Fässler, who will provide us numerous genetically engineered fibroblasts (e.g. knock-outs of av, ß1, ILK, talin, kindlin).In the proposed funding period we aim to achieve the following goals:i) Unravel integrin induced crosstalk that signals enhanced a5ß1 adhesionii) Characterize crosstalk dependent shear enhanced adhesion of single integrins and single cells iii) Delineate integrin localization and ligand-binding using high-resolution functional AFM imagingThis comprehensive study will provide valuable information on how a5ß1 and avß3 integrins regulate cell adhesion to fibronectin and hence delineate their distinct (and co-operative) role in an adhesome. It will also throw light on localization pattern of integrins, which governs the biophysical nature of their interaction with the ECM and dynamic cytoskeleton. The understanding of these mechanisms will not only appreciate normal physiological processes such as development and wound healing but also aid the therapeutics for progression of various inflammatory diseases and cancer.",Biophysics Group D-BSSE ETH Zurich,Basel,573959,0000-0003-3075-0665,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication;Exchange of personnel",Switzerland,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Grasslands are at the core of the Jura agriculture and justify financial support of the government, whose agricultural policy supports forage autonomy of herbivore herds. The expected increase in extreme climatic events will cause significant constraints on grassland systems that are particularly sensitive to drought. As a result, farmers must adapt grassland management, as well as their breeding objectives. Identifying potential interactive effects of different factors, such as altitude and management, with different water availability scenarios is therefore a major challenge to anticipate the performance of grasslands and the reliability of production at a regional scale under future climate variability. The current project will focus on the response of pastures to simulated spring and summer droughts along an altitudinal gradient and according to two management schemes. The objective of the project is twofold: i) provide agronomical references and management clues for forage production under altered precipitation regimes to anticipate potential yield losses and to adapt to future climate extremes, ii) identify ecological mechanisms that drive grassland responses to understand grassland resistance and resilience to drought events and predict their evolution under future climate. To achieve both applied and fundamental goals, agronomical monitoring will be combined with ecological approaches. A plant functional approach will be implemented to address changes in species and functional compositions of grasslands in response to altered environmental conditions. Moreover, relevant and innovative ecophysiological measurements will be developed to assess drought resistance mechanisms at the plant species level. Through the development of knowledge, the proposed project will significantly add in our understanding of the response of grassland communities to future climate variability, and will contribute to ecological theories.

Here we studied hydraulic failure in herbaceous angiosperms by measuring the pressure inducing 50 loss of hydraulic conductance (P50) in stems of 26 species mainly European grasses (Poaceae). Our measurements show a large range in P50 from 20.5 to 27.5 MPa which overlaps with 94 of the woody angiosperm species in a worldwide published data set and which strongly correlates with an aridity index. Moreover the P50 values obtained were substantially more negative than the midday water potentials for five grass species monitored throughout the entire growing season suggesting that embolism formation and repair are not routine and mainly occur under water deficits. These results show that both herbs and trees share the ability to withstand very negative water potentials without considerable embolism formation in their xylem conduits during drought stress. In addition structure function trade offs in grass stems reveal that more resistant species are more lignified which was confirmed for herbaceous and closely related woody species of the daisy group (Asteraceae). Our findings could imply that herbs with more lignified stems will become more abundant in future grasslands under more frequent and severe droughts potentially resulting in lower forage digestibility.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for body size in humans have identified several hundred genes that contribute to height in the context of heterogeneous environmental factors such as nutrition. On the other hand, systematic genetics screens conducted under controlled environmental conditions in the model organism Drosophila have identified some 200 genes encoding components of highly conserved signaling pathways that regulate normal and abnormal growth. Thus far it has been difficult to link these two approaches and to understand how conserved pathways generate size diversity within and between species. Over the past five years, to address these questions, we have applied GWAS to three size-related traits in a set of well-characterized, inbred Drosophila lines (DGRP) under carefully controlled environmental conditions. We find a large sex- and trait-specific variation in genes associated with these traits. The function of many of these genes in size control has been functionally validated and the genes have been linked to the conserved pathway components by epistasis analysis. In collaboration with the group of Ruedi Aebersold we have begun to complement the GWAS approach with proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) using SWATH proteomics. Our results demonstrate a remarkable robustness of protein expression levels in light of the high genetic and phenotypic variability of the tested lines. Significant protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) point to the important role of metabolic pathways downstream of the conserved pathways controlling size variation. Building on these novel and surprising findings we aim, in this proposal, to further address the question whether differences in size arise primarily by altering the activity of the evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways or by altering the response of their output processes. In order to achieve this goal we will pursue the following six objectives. We will (i) replicate our GWAS and PWAS with an independent collection of lines to eliminate population specific effects; (ii) compare the GWAS and PWAS from our inbred lines with those of lines that have been artificially selected for wing size traits from a DGRP base population; (iii) validate pQTLs genetically; (iv) perform GWAS and PWAS on head size as an independent size trait for which we detected little genetic overlap with the control of wing size; (v) examine the relationship between protein dynamics, size and the dynamics of pQTLs by performing PWAS separately for each of and across three different stages during development and (vi) extend the PWAS to the phospho-proteome of wing discs.",Institut für Molekulare Systembiologie  ETH Zürich,Zürich,3472,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication;Research Infrastructures;Exchange of personnel",United States of America,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),Proteome-wide association studies identify biochemical modules associated with a wing-size phenotype in Drosophila melanogaster,"Okada Hirokazu,  Ebhardt H.

To advance the understanding of the genotype–phenotype relationships towards the level of biochemical processes we perform a proteome wide association study (PWAS) of a complex quantitative phenotype. We quantify the variation of wing imaginal disc proteomes in Drosophila genetic reference panel (DGRP) lines using SWATH mass spectrometry. In spite of the very large genetic variation (1/36 bp) between the lines proteome variability is surprisingly small indicating strong molecular resilience of protein expression patterns. Proteins associated with adult wing size form tight co variation clusters that are enriched in fundamental biochemical processes. Wing size correlates with some basic metabolic functions positively with glucose metabolism but negatively with mitochondrial respiration and not with ribosome biogenesis. Our study highlights the power of PWAS to filter functional variants from the large genetic variability in natural populations.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The central role of transcription factors (TFs) and their networks (TFNs) in controlling HSPC fates in well recognized. However, it is unclear how the TF expression in their TFNs is regulated and how precise integration of cytokine signaling with the TFN controls HSPC fate decisions. One major reason is that complex HSPC differentiation systems are usually analyzed at only the population level and / or only at individual time points. However, for a comprehensive understanding of molecular cell fate control, both cell behavior and molecular expression or activity have to be quantified at the single cell level and continuously over many days. We have developed novel bioimaging systems allowing the continuous long-term quantification of cell behavior and protein expression or activity in individual differentiating cells. We will use these approaches to quantify, continuously and at the single cell level, cellular behavior, TF expression and cytokine signaling activity during HSPC differentiation. In combination with inducible molecular manipulation of TF expression and signaling activity, this novel kind of data will be used to generate improved models of HSPC fate control. In addition to analyzing existing TF reporter lines, we will generate novel reporter mouse lines to extend current analyses to other TFs. Novel microfluidic devices will be designed and produced to allow the high throughput combinatorial manipulation of culture conditions during long term time-lapse of HSPC cultures.

For cells with low Nanog expression we identified two distinct colony types: one re expressed Nanog in a mosaic pattern and the other did not re express Nanog over many generations. Although both expressed pluripotency markers they exhibited differences in their TF protein correlation networks and differentiation propensities. Sister cell analysis revealed that differences in Nanog levels are not necessarily accompanied by differences in the expression of other pluripotency factors.

Mortality is mostly due to metastatic disease and presently there is great need to understand the factors governing the clinical evolution of prostate cancer and identify new therapeutic strategies. ETS transcription factors have emerged as important elements in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. About half of prostate tumors harbors chromosomal translocations involving ETS genes, the most frequent being the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion. However, the biological function of the endogenous ETS gene network and its relationship with translocated ETS in prostate tumorigenesis has been poorly investigated. ETS transcription factors are nodal points of critical signaling pathways controlling cell differentiation, proliferation and survival in many cells and tissues. In the human genome there are 27 distinct ETS factors that share the highly conserved ETS DNA binding domain. We have examined the expression of the ETS gene family in normal and prostate cancer tissue samples. In the course of this study, we identified endogenously expressed ETS factors that, in addition to the translocated ETS, could contribute to prostate tumorigenesis. Specifically, we found that the epithelial-specific ETS factor ESE3/EHF, which is normally expressed in prostate epithelial cells, was down-regulated in about 50% of prostate tumors. We have strong evidences supporting a tumor suppressor function of ESE3/EHF in prostate cancer. Data from our group support a direct role of ESE3/EHF in the maintenance of prostate epithelial cell differentiation and in restraining the cancer stem cell compartment. Knock-down of ESE3/EHF in immortalized human prostate epithelial cells resulted in the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and acquisition of stem-like properties. More recent data support a direct role of ESE3/EHF in controlling key genes and microRNAs involved in the expansion of the cancer stem cell compartment. Our data indicate that modulation of these target genes successfully reverses transformation and stemness. During the past few years we have characterized prostate tumors with loss of ESE3/EHF expression. We found that ESE3low tumors have distinctive molecular and biological characteristics, including enrichment of EMT and stem-like features. Reduced expression of ESE3/EHF has a negative prognostic impact significantly reducing overall survival in large cohorts of patients with primary prostate cancers suggesting that ESE3low tumors may represent a subgroup of more aggressive prostate tumors. Intriguingly, our preliminary data support the notion that ESE3low tumors have also alterations of the androgenic signaling network, may be resistant to androgen blockade and thus may require alternative therapeutic strategies. Collectively, our data support that ESE3/EHF constitutes in the normal prostate a barrier for prostate transformation and a brake for the induction of cells with stem-like properties. These data encourage further studies to understand the role of this transcription factor in prostate epithelial cell differentiation, cancer stem cells and transformation. Furthermore, our data encourage further characterization of the ESE3low tumors to develop novel diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic strategies for these aggressive tumors.Accordingly, the overall project has these specific aims: Specific Aim 1. Evaluation and functional characterization of the transcriptional network associated with cancer stem cells and its relationship with ESE3/EHF. Specific Aim 2.  Evaluation of the crosstalk between ESE3/EHF and androgen signalling pathway.Specific Aim 3.  Evaluation of the consequences of ESE3/EHF loss in newly generated ESE3KO mouse model. Together the studies proposed in this application will advance our understanding of the complex role of the ETS transcription factors in prostate cancer pathogenesis and will contribute to the development of precision medicine approaches for the treatment of prostate cancer.

Here we demonstrate that indole which was identified using a screen for Arabidopsis growth promotion by VOCs from soil borne bacteria is a potent plant growth modulator. Its prominent role in increasing the plant secondary root network is mediated by interfering with the auxin signalling machinery. Using auxin reporter lines and classic auxin physiological and transport assays we show that the indole signal invades the plant body reaches zones of auxin activity and acts in a polar auxin transport dependent bimodal mechanism to trigger differential cellular auxin responses. Our results suggest that indole beyond its importance as a bacterial signal molecule can serve as a remote messenger to manipulate plant growth and development.,149271,"Media relations: print media, online media",Bakterien aus dem Wurzelbereich hemmen den Erreger der Kraut- und Knollenfäule,,2014

Low UV doses enable calcium and phosphorous metabolic regulation, vitamin D photosynthesis, and treatment of some skin conditions. Excessive UV exposure can cause cataract and premature skin aging. Mostly, UV radiation is the main causal factor for cutaneous melanoma and epithelial skin cancer. Societal and behavioral changes over the last century have led to unprecedented and steady increases in the incidence of skin cancer in Caucasian populations. Worldwide, the annual burden of skin cancer is about 13 million new cases and 60,000 premature deaths. Most deaths are from melanoma, the most lethal form of skin cancer.Epidemiological evidence supports different effects from intermittent (recreational or vacation) and chronic (occupational) exposure on skin cancer risk, although the dose-response relationship between UV exposure and skin cancer is not fully elucidated. High inter- and intra-individual (anatomical) variations in UV doses received make exposure assessment challenging and exposure data is scarce. To address this issue, the applicants’ team, gathering competencies in meteorology, 3D computing sciences, public health and exposure sciences, developed a numeric simulation tool (SimUVEx) to predict anatomical UV exposure. SimUVEx uses 3D computer graphics techniques to compute UV doses based on postural information and ambient UV measurements. It allows assessment of specific exposure scenarios, taking into account body surface inclination, orientation to the sun and shading from other body parts. In this project, applicants intend to move from individual-based to population-based exposure assessments (SimUVEx v2). The temporal, spatial and morphological simulation capabilities of SimUVEx will first be expanded. The meteorological model will be improved in order to provide UV irradiance data for the whole of Switzerland (eventually the whole of Europe). Radiation estimates for cloudless situations, based on radiation transfer models, will be combined with satellites retrievals to derive ground UV radiation at locations and times of interest. By combining exposure datasets and global ground irradiance data, anatomical exposure estimates under various exposure conditions, for different geographical locations and over different time periods could be produced. Outputs from SimUVEx v2 will allow exploring exposure data, building exposure scenarios (using for instance population-based survey of frequent outdoor occupations) and identifying high-risk situations with respect to over- and under-exposures to sunlight. Identifying at-risk situations and producing reference doses for common outdoor occupational and leisure activities will: (1) improve our understanding of exposure patterns, (2) identify potential shortcomings in current sun protection recommendations (3) enable to assess and quantify most effective sun protection strategies, and (4) provide exploitable data to the community for future research.",Institut universitaire romand de Santé au Travail UNISANTÉ,Epalinges,81267,0000-0002-3304-8727,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",Germany,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),Facial exposure to ultraviolet radiation: Predicted sun protection effectiveness of various hat styles. ,"Backes Claudine,  Religi Arianna,  Vuilleumier Laurent,  VernezDavid,  Bulliard Jean-Luc",Published,2018,,10.1111/phpp.12388,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/phpp.12388,Photodermatol.

This study aimed at quantifying hats’ sun protection effectiveness in various exposure conditions by predicting UVR exposure doses and their anatomical distributions.    Methods  A well‐defined 3‐dimensional head morphology and 4 hat styles (a cap a helmet a middle‐ and a wide‐brimmed hat) were added to a previously published model. Midday (12:00‐14:00) and daily (08:00‐17:00) seasonal UVR doses were estimated at various facial skin zones with and without hat wear accounting for each UVR component. Protection effectiveness was calculated by the relative reduction in predicted UVR dose expressed as a predictive protection factor (PPF).    Results  The unprotected entire face received 2.5 times higher UVR doses during a summer midday compared to a winter midday (3.3 vs 1.3 standard erythema dose [SED]) with highest doses received at the nose (6.1 SED). During a cloudless summer day the lowest mean UVR dose is received by the entire face protected by a wide‐brimmed hat (1.7 SED). No hat reached 100 protection at any facial skin zone (PPFmax: 76). Hats’ sun protection effectiveness varied highly with environmental conditions and was mainly limited by the high contribution of diffuse UVR irrespective of hat style. Larger brim sizes afforded greater facial protection than smaller brim sizes except around midday when the sun position is high.    Conclusion  Consideration of diffuse and reflected UVR in sun educational messages could improve sun protection effectiveness.,152803,"Media relations: print media, online media",Dimmi come ti comporti sotto il sole e ti dirò quanto sei a rischio,https://oggiscienza.it/2016/01/04/sole-abbronzatura-radiazioni-melanoma/,2016

Among the most active EDs are natural and synthetic steroid hormones. Until recently, most attention has been given to estrogens, whereas progestins and corticosteroids have little been regarded. Progestins are particularly important as some of them may compromise fish reproduction at a few ng/L. They are used in contraception and medicine, often in combination with 17a-ethinyl estradiol (EE2). P4, its metabolites and synthetic progestins occur in wastewater and in runoffs from animal farms. Corticosteroids are used for many medical applications. Both groups of steroids are only partly eliminated in wastewater treatment and occur in the low ng/L range in surface water. Given the high activity, continuous use, and lack of sufficient ecotoxicological data, it is important to investigate potential adverse effects of these environmental steroids in more detail, both as single compounds and as mixtures. Research is particularly needed on unexplored steroids and their mixtures occurring in the environment. This project aims to deepen our understanding of molecular and physiological effects of selected progestins and glucocorticoids. By combining transcriptional with reproductive and physiological effects, a more complete understanding of their potential adverse effects will be obtained. By employing zebrafish as a model species, the project has the following aims and objectives:1.To assess reproductive, transcriptional and histological effects of a progestin and mixtures with EE2 in breeding pairs. The hypothesis of independent action will be tested.2.To assess transcriptional alterations induced by a progestin alone and in combination with EE2 in embryos using a targeted gene expression approach. Thereby, the hypothesis of independent action will be tested.3.To assess developmental and transcriptional effects of glucocorticoids by targeted gene expression analysis in zebrafish embryos, and to compare with progestins. Mixtures of progestins and glucocorticoids will be assessed to analyze their combined effect.4.To investigate the role of hormone receptors for development and for their effects in zebrafish embryos. The contribution of receptors is differentiated by knockdown of specific mRNAs by anti-sense techniques using morpholino oligonucleotides.These studies linking transcription analysis with physiological effects and knockdown of receptors will allow a better understanding of molecular effects of progestins and glucocorticoids, their physiological action, and the effects of steroid hormone mixtures. Ultimately, the results are important for environmental hazards and risk assessment of progestins and glucocorticoids for aquatic ecosystems.

A problem of clinical trials is the comparability: Often, different dosimetric concepts have been used and temporal aspects such as time gaps between application of heat and ionizing radiation have not been considered. The recent state of research is not sufficient to support biological treatment planning or optimisation of clinical HT-RT treatments. Clinical trials are faced with the inhomogeneity of treatments due to physiological response (impact of perfusion regulation to temperature during heating) and clinical workflow reasons (time gaps). Therefore, a better understanding of the effects of heating in combination with radiation can lead to adequate thermal dose concepts supporting planning and optimisation of treatments and allowing a comparison of different RT-HT treatment sessions. In this study, it is planned to focus on protein-related aspects interfering with DNA damage formation and repair, cell death mechanisms and immune response (esp. HSP related aspects).We intend to combine the strengths of advanced dynamical modelling using biophysical dynamic state variables with time resolved biological experiments in vitro and in vivo. As a starting point, the Multi-Hit-Repair (MHR-) model will be used, since this model is able to cover a large variety of radio-biological phenomena and the time-gap dependences of survival data from HT-RT experi-ments in vitro. Time resolved data from Comet- and ?H2AX - assays, western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining for heat-shock proteins will be used for evaluating the model parameters by an evolutionary optimisation algorithm (in a first step with survival data in vitro as primary training data set and other data as test data). The data in vivo will be gained from biopsy material of animal patients (dogs) treated with heat and radiation at the Veterinary Hospital Zurich. Modifications and extensions of the model with the aim of an adequate description of the relationship between temperature, timing and effect (dynamic dose concept) will be compared systematically to the experimental results. The MHR model uses a simplistic approach for calculating the dynamic state variables??Some recent work in the field of statistical mechanics and protein biophysics will be used to refine the concept of dynamic state variables describing protein damages. The validation of these dose concepts by clinical trial with human patients is not intended to be a part of this project. But the preparation of methods and tools for this step is envisaged. It is therefore planned to implement promising candidate for dose quantities in a dose calculator allowing the automatic read-in of the temperature output of the treatment units in use. The thermal dose quantities will be compared to the available clinical output of animal treatments.The planned research can deliver important contributions to theoretical biology and clinical anti-cancer treatment as well. Regarding theoretical aspects of biology and biophysics, the deve-lopment of concepts enabling the coverage of the complex dynamics of biological systems could play a pivotal role in understanding synergistic effects of combined therapies beyond HT-RT. With this project, it is intended to demonstrate the usefulness of dynamic state variables and to elaborate the relation of these quantities to the molecular level by exploiting statistical thermodynamics of life. The approach of using state variables to describe radiation induced protein damage, followed by a subsequent reduction of repair capability of cells is novel.

LNSC functions include the generation of a tissue scaffold for the support of hematopoietic cells, the release of chemoattractants that facilitate migration and interactions between hematopoietic cells, and homeostasis of immune cells. Recently, LNSCs, and in particular two subtypes, the fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) and lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), have been shown to express antigens (Ags) otherwise restricted to a small number of peripheral tissues. Direct presentation of peripheral tissue Ags (PTA) by LECs and FRCs to CD8+ T cells results in their abortive proliferation and deletion. These findings suggest that LN-LECs and LN-FRCs perform functions in the periphery similar to that of medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) to promote T cell tolerance. We have recently demonstrated that LECs and FRCs acquire peptide-MHCII complexes from dendritic cells (DCs), and present them to CD4+ T cells to induce T cell dysfunction. Additionally, LEC and FRC show significant levels of endogenous MHCII, especially under inflammatory conditions. However, whether LEC and FRC Ag presentation through endogenous MHCII molecules has an impact on CD4+ T cells responses remains unknown. Our preliminary data suggest that the selective loss of MHCII expression on LNSCs in murine LN impairs peripheral CD4+ T cell tolerance and alters regulatory T cell (Treg) populations, resulting in signs of spontaneous autoimmunity in elderly. The aims 1 and 2 of this proposal will determine how LECs and/or FRCs contribute to MHCII-mediated self-reactive CD4+ T cell inactivation, and identify the mechanisms accounting for T cell tolerance maintenance. In aim 1, we plan to dissect the consequences of the selective abrogation of endogenous MHCII expression by LECs and/or FRCs on self-reactive CD4+ T cell responses, and the subsequent impact on autoimmunity development. Aim 2 will identify the molecular pathways by which LECs and FRCs present self-Ags through MHCII molecules. In particular, we will determine whether those cells, similarly to mTECs, can target PTAs to the autophagic pathway and deliver them to MHCII compartments. Alternatively, stromal cell-unsheathed conduit networks transport small Ags, which raise the hypothesis that LECs and FRCs acquire exogenous self-Ags and present them via MHCII molecules to CD4+ T cells. Notably, in the context of tumor development, LECs substantially expand and lymphatic drainage is consequently increased in both the tumor itself and tumor-draining LNs. Furthermore, LN-like structures develop intratumorally and exhibit most of FRC features. Therefore, LEC and FRC ability to capture Ags will be potentially enhanced in a tumoral context. Aim 3 will therefore determine the role of Ag-presentation by LECs and FRCs in tumor immunity. We will dissect the molecular and cellular features of tumor-associated LECs and FRCs in their ability to capture and present tumor Ags to CD4+ T cells, and how the selective abrogation of those functions will impact anti-tumor T cell immunity and tumor growth. These aims will be addressed using various gene-targeted mouse strains, amongst them mice in which LECs or FRCs are deficient or enhanced for specific functions, in combination with fluorescent reporter mice, in vivo mouse model of diseases and functional T cell analysis.Overall, our project will generate fundamental new insights into the contribution of LNSCs, in particular LECs and FRCs, to peripheral T cell responses as unconventional Ag presenting cells (APCs). Emerging perception of our understanding from recent studies suggests that LNSCs would function as tolerogenic APCs. A confirmation of this concept would significantly change and extend the current perspective on how to promote or in contrast inhibit T cell tolerance in the treatment of autoimmune diseases and cancer development, respectively.

Consequently, a vast proportion of a cell's resources is dedicated to this process, which is reflected in the ribosomes taking up a large fraction of a cell's mass. Proliferative states are associated with a further increase in the fraction of the cellular mass dedicated to the translation machinery. The translation process is targeted by many antibacterial agents which exploit the fact that bacterial ribosomes differ from those of eukaryotes. Moreover, a global reduction in translation by means of inhibiting the RNA polymerase I is being explored as a therapeutic possibility in cancers. In recent years, novel mechanisms for modulating the rate, efficiency or site of translation, either globally or for specific transcripts, in relation to the cellular state have been uncovered. Among these are condition-specific alterations in transfer RNA abundance, expression of particular ribosomal proteins in specific disease states, the change in the RNA-binding protein interactome of transcripts through alternative polyadenylation, and RNA modifications such as the 1 or 6-methyladenosine. Nevertheless, the relative importance of translation and transcription regulation for gene expression is highly debated and the breadth and mechanisms underlying dynamic changes in translation are not well understood. Evidence has started to emerge that dynamic sub-cellular structures that are organized in part by multi-valent RNAs and in part by proteins with intrinsically disordered domains play a role. The aim of the project proposed here is to characterize the role of specific mechanisms that we have uncovered in our previous work, in modulating mRNA translation in relation to normal and disease states. Thus, we would like to investigate the impact on mRNA translation of systematic changes in 3’UTR lengths as a result of changes in cell state (e.g. cell differentiation) or in the expression of regulators of 3’UTR length. Having already identified systems in which the aforementioned behaviors can be studied, we would now like to undertake their molecular characterization and evaluate their relevance for cell differentiation, development and cancer. Succinctly, the work outlined in this proposal aims to elucidate cell type-specific translational programs that are rooted in specific regulators and could open new avenues for engineering cellular behaviors. At the same time, we hope that through a nuanced understanding of how translation is regulated in different conditions we will enable targeted manipulations of the process for therapeutic applications.",Biozentrum der Universität Basel,Basel,509437,0000-0002-8832-2041,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results",Switzerland,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This disease has a complex physiopathology, in which knee loading plays a central role. For example, OA develops about 10 times more often in the medial compartment, where most of the load is transmitted. Mechanical interventions, particularly in the form of footwear, are thus of primary interest to slow OA progression. Unfortunately, the lateral wedges commonly considered in the past did not consistently reduce pain. This failure could be due to the incapacity of lateral wedges to produce all the changes in knee biomechanics needed for these patients.The external knee adduction moment (KAM) is the variable the most frequently used to assess the loading environment at the knee joint, and reducing its amplitude is the target of most current mechanical interventions because of its strong association with medial OA. Nevertheless, other gait variables start to be consistently associated with disease progression as well. These observations suggest that interventions should not solely focus on diminishing the KAM, but should attempt to modify a general pattern of knee movement. During this project, two clinical studies will be conducted to describe the overall pattern of knee kinetics and kinematics associated with increasing OA severity and to characterize the effects of shoe interventions on this pattern.Various shoes have been proposed to modify ambulatory biomechanics of knee OA patients. Nevertheless, today there is a lack of shoes where the properties of the sole can be adjusted individually. To fill this gap, this project will develop new adjustable units, which will be included in the midsole of the proposed intervention shoe. Clinical experiments done with this novel shoe could help knee OA care by highlighting the necessity of personalized footwear interventions.This project aims to improve treatment options and fundamental understanding of medial knee OA by designing and testing an intervention shoe allowing individual adjustment of sole properties in order to reduce OA-related alterations in knee biomechanics. Specifically, this project will test the primary hypotheses that: 1) there is an overall pattern of gait alterations from non-OA to end-stage medial OA knees; 2) there is a general relationship among patients between changes in ambulatory knee biomechanics and sole properties; 3) medial knee OA patients wearing the proposed intervention shoes individually adjusted have a clinically important improvement in pain after one month.",Service Universitaire d'Orthopédie et de Traumatologie de l'Appareil Moteur Hôpital Orthopédique de la Suisse Romande,Lausanne,122322,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",United States of America,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,166433,Talks/events/exhibitions,Conférence publique sur l'arthrose des membres inférieurs,,2017

GoalsThe overall goal of the Epidemiology and Mathematical Modelling for Infectious disease Control (EpideMMIC) project is to strengthen the integration of epidemiological, statistical and mathematical modelling methods for evaluating preventive interventions. Specific objectives focus on the following interventions: Objective 1, screening programmes for Chlamydia trachomatis; Objective 2, point-of-care tests to distinguish aetiologies of male urethritis and control antimicrobial resistant Mycoplasma genitalium; Objective 3, human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination strategies to prevent anal cancer. Methods of investigationObjective 1: We will evaluate new data about chlamydia prevalence and screening impact using two approaches, 1) a Bayesian inferential framework for a C. trachomatis transmission model using observational data from Great Britain and 2) compare two dynamic modelling frameworks using randomised controlled trial data from Australia. We then aim to apply the Bayesian framework to objectives 2 and 3. Objective 2: a dual infection model of C. trachomatis and M. genitalium transmission, incorporating resistant strains to investigate the impact on antimicrobial resistance of point-of-care aetiological diagnosis of male urethritis and detection of genetic resistance markers. Objective 3: a model that combines HPV transmission and anal disease progression to investigate male HPV vaccination strategies in men who have sex with men, taking into account HPV and HIV interactions.TimescaleApril 2015 to March 2018Importance and impactThe EpideMMIC project is important for its contributions in three areas. First, EpideMMIC project outputs have already contributed to public health decision making for infectious disease control both internationally and in Switzerland. The research themes that we propose now are both topical and important. Second, we will contribute to methodological advances through the development of a Bayesian inferential framework for age-structured transmission dynamic models for non-immunising infections. Third, the EpideMMIC project has a record of providing a stimulating environment to develop careers in infectious disease epidemiology and this proposal offers new opportunities for original research.

The parasite promastigote forms are deposited during a sand fly blood meal in the skin of mammals. Within a few days the parasites transforms into the amastigote forms and replicate inside macrophages. There currently exists no efficient vaccine against human Leishmaniasis. Several factors including the infecting Leishmania species and host factors determine the type of disease that will develop following an infection. Increasing evidence points out to a crucial role for neutrophils in disease outcome. Neutrophils may play either a beneficial or a deleterious role in Leishmaniasis and the mechanisms responsible for such a difference are not yet understood. Neutrophils are also present within non-healing cutaneous lesions, but the impact of these neutrophils and their interactions with the amastigote form of the parasite, as well as that with local inflammatory cells, is not well defined. In order to control the disease, an efficient adaptive immune response is required. The Notch signalling pathway is involved in the regulation of immune responses and we have shown that expression of Notch signalling on T helper cells is critical for lesion resolution following L. major infection. Notch signalling is involved in the fine-tuning of peripheral CD4+ T helper immune response and plays a role in splenic marginal zone B cell development however, the role of Notch receptors on B cell activation and the generation of memory B cells are still not well characterized.Based on previously published and unpublished data (see 2.2.2) we intend in this proposal to perform the following investigations:A. Decipher the mechanisms involved in the critical roles played by neutrophils at the onset of infection as well as during the chronic non-healing phase of the disease following infection with L. mexicana or L. major Working hypotheses and specific aims: 1) We hypothesize that distinct Leishmania species contribute to different microenvironments at the site of infection and that transient parasite passage within neutrophils affects their virulence. We aim to investigate how parasite presence within neutrophils affects gene regulation a) of the cells present at the site of infection and b) of the parasite. We further aim to investigate if these pattern differ following L. major versus L. mexicana infection.2) We hypothesize that neutrophils can rapidly and transiently migrate from the site of infection to the draining lymph nodes (dLN) where they may influence the launching of adaptive immune response. We aim to investigate if they egress from the skin to the dLN via the lymphatics. We also want to investigate the cellular interactions taking place between neutrophils and other cell types in the live dLN.3) We hypothesize that the neutrophils present within non-healing lesions interact with amastigotes and macrophages but may not kill the parasites. We aim to analyze amastigote-neutrophil-macrophage interactions within unhealing lesions.Expected value of the proposed projects: Leishmaniases are complex diseases involving innate and adaptive immunity. A better understanding of the role of neutrophils early in infection and their interaction with parasites at the site of infection, as well as the importance of the transient presence of neutrophils in the draining lymph node, will extend our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms leading to the development of a protective versus non-cured response to infection. This should lead to potential applications for the design of prophylactic or therapeutic measures.

We anticipate that our unique approach, combining highly integrated elastomer-based actuators with time-lapse microscopy, transcriptome analyses and transcriptional network perturbations, will yield the comprehensive analysis of cellular and transcriptional responses of LECs to mechanical stretch. Lymphatic vasculature, present in virtually all tissues of the body, is critically important for human physiology and pathology. Lymphatic vessels serve three main purposes: a) pumping interstitial fluid, cells, and small molecules back to the blood stream, b) transporting antigens and antigen-presenting cells to lymph nodes to contribute to adaptive immune response, and c) maintaining body metabolism, via the uptake of dietary fat and fat soluble vitamins. The current understanding of growth factors and intracellular pathways important for vessel growth and maturation is well advanced.  In contrast, remarkably little is known about contribution of mechanical forces to the biological responses of lymphatic vessels.Two labs from very different fields (engineering and biology) join forces to bring a novel approach to performing the first ever analysis of cellular and transcriptional responses of LECs to mechanical stretch, in the presence and the absence of known mechanosensitive and lymphatic endothelial identity transcription factors. Our unique approach to study the stretch response of LECs is to use highly-integrated elastomer-based actuators serving as transparent active substrates applying well-controlled periodic strain to the cells cultured on it. The active substrates are driven by dielectric elastomer actuators, a type of electroactive polymer that deforms reversibly when an electric field is applied, allowing us to apply well-controlled periodic stretching while staying in focus, enabling time-lapse high resolution microscopy. We anticipate that these studies will a) provide a detailed characterization of the effects of cyclic stretch on LEC proliferation, apoptosis, re-organization of cell junctions and cytoskeleton, and b) will also establish the role of key transcriptional networks in the generation of such response. In particular we will study the role of the main regulators of lymphatic endothelial cell identity (PROX1), collecting vessel phenotype (FOXC2) or key integrators of stretch response in other cell types (YAP1 or TAZ).  Such knowledge will be important for developing novel approaches for modulation of lymphatic vessel function. Characterization of such responses will provide additional opportunities for pharmacological intervention in human disorders, where lymphatic vessels play important role, such as chronic inflammation, lymphedema and tumor metastasis. We anticipate that the availability of compact and transparent stretch devices will be useful to a broader scientific community, for e.g. time-lapse quantitative analyses of mechanosensitive signaling pathways or studying the role of stretch in heterotypic cell-cell interaction, such as endothelial cells and smooth muscle, tumor or immune cells.",Département d'Oncologie Fondamentale Université de Lausanne,Epalinges,53704,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",Switzerland,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,166326,Other activities,Stretching cells to learn more about them,https://actu.epfl.ch/news/stretching-cells-to-learn-more-about-them/,2016

BackgroundIn our daily lives the correct perception of the meaning of a sound needs to be combined with the information about its location and its temporal features. The neural mechanisms that underlie the combined representations are only partially understood. The dual-stream model of auditory processing, based on seminal studies in human and non-human primates, posits that sound identification and sound localization are performed in distinct cortical networks, referred to as the ventral and dorsal streams. Recent studies indicate that a third, separate processing stream combines semantic and spatial information and provides a position-linked representation of sound objects, which facilitates sound discrimination and orienting. The semantic precision that is carried by the position-linked representation as well as its neural substrate are only partially understood. Temporal analysis and temporal order judgments of auditory events are known to be influenced by the experience of previous stimuli, suggesting changes in memory traces as possible underlying mechanisms. Very little is known about how the coding of temporal features relates to the semantic representation of sounds. The combined representations of semantic & spatial and semantic & temporal aspects may offer new strategies for the rehabilitation of neurological deficits such as neglect.1.2. Working hypothesesi)The position-linked representation of sound objects relies on a rough semantic representation, which is sustained by the temporal cortex and allows a rapid categorization. Fine-grained semantic representations may not benefit from it, unless specific, over-trained expertise is present. It remains to be determined whether extra-auditory representations of specific sound categories, such as the frontal cortex for action-related sounds or the amygdala and limbic cortex for emotional sounds, code in a position-linked fashion.ii)Temporal analysis and temporal judgments involve the representations of sound objects (and not only of sound features); subjective changes in temporal perception are associated with changes in sound object coding.iii)The position-linked representation of sound objects is ancillary to a multimodal representation of space. Sensory-motor modulations of the multimodal space representation, such as by means of prismatic adaptation, are likely to influence the representation of the auditory space and the position-linked representation of sound objects.iv)The position-linked representation of sounds, with its role in spatial orienting and in sound discrimination, may represent a valuable tool for the rehabilitation of cognitive functions after brain damage. Its preservation vs impairment is likely to be indicative for the success of specific rehabilitation strategies. 1.3. Specific aimsi)Determine the neural substrate of position-linked representation of environmental sounds and in particular the contribution of early-stage auditory areas. Determine whether extra-auditory parts of sound object representations, such as within the motor-premotor-prefrontal cortex for action-related sounds and in the amygdala and limbic cortex for emotional sounds, participate in the position-linked representation. Assess the level of semantic precision that is supported by the position-linked representation and how it is modulated by expertise.ii)Determine the neural substrate of the temporal sensory-motor recalibration, which links a motor action to a sound (agency effect). Assess the role of pre-existing auditory-motor links that support the representation of action-related sounds.iii)Determine the effect of visuo-motor or visuo-auditory-motor recalibration by means of prismatic adaptation on position-linked representation of sound objects and compare it with that on explicit sound localization and on auditory attention. Compare the effects between normal subjects and brain-damaged patients.iv)Investigate the potential of position-linked representation of sound objects for cognitive neurorehabilitation. Compare the effects of therapeutic interventions in neglect patients with preserved vs impaired position-linked representation. 1.4. Experimental design and methodsProject A. Position-linked representations will be investigated in normal subjects using 7T fMRI or AEPs. In a given experiment priming effects will be analyzed in 2 different conditions (e. g. intra- vs intercategorial context), and for pairs of stimuli for which the initial and repeated presentation will have the same or different lateralization, by means of a 2 x 2 ANOVA. The disturbance and the reorganization of position-linked representations will be investigated in patients with focal brain lesions.Project B. Temporal modulation of auditory representations will be investigated in normal subjects using AEPs and 7T (or 3T) fMRI; the latter will be analyzed also using a multivoxel pattern analysis. The disturbance and reorganization of temporal modulations of auditory representations will be investigated in patients with focal brain lesions.Project C. The effects of prismatic adaptation on sound localization and on spatial release from masking will be analyzed behaviourally and with 7T and 3T fMRI in normal subjects and brain-damaged patients. Project D. The anatomo-clinical correlations of preserved vs impaired position-linked representation of sound objects in brain damage will be assessed with voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping. The assessment of prismatic adaptation based rehabilitation on neglect will be assessed in an ABAB design, with intermediate behavioural and fMRI evaluations.1.5. Expected value of the proposed projectThe primary importance of the project is conceptual, in that it will help to understand complex auditory representations. Understanding how semantic representation is linked to the spatial or temporal characteristics of an object may give insight into multisensory and object-related representations of space. Better understanding of the underlying mechanisms is likely to focus indications for specific rehabilitation paradigms, which we will explore here for neglect, or to help to design new therapies.",Division de Neuropsychologie CHUV,Lausanne,46150,0000-0001-9393-5718,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",Switzerland,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),Supramodal effect of rightward prismatic adaptation on spatial representations within the ventral attentional system,"Tissieres Isabel,  Fornari Eleonora,  Clarke Stephanie,  Crottaz-Herbette Sonia",Published,2017,,10.1007/s00429-017-1572-2,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00429-017-1572-2,Brain Structure and Function,,Brain Structure and Function,223,,1459,1471,Brain Structure and Function,,,159708,Talks/events/exhibitions,Forum de la Semaine du Cerveau 'Identité humaine - une affaire de neurones?',,2019

However, even the most effective treatment options in immunotherapy, including the adoptive transfer of tumor-specific T cells into patients, result in an objective clinical response in only a minority of patients. One reason may be that many tumors lack the ability to recruit cytotoxic T cells, which can render them resistant to current immunotherapy approaches. Strategies that reinforce the migration of T cells into tumors are therefore urgently needed to complement existing treatments that foster the antitumor effector function of T cells. In a model of gastric cancer, we have previously demonstrated that T cells do not infiltrate the tumors, even upon adoptive transfer of tumor-specific T cells. We have recently developed a treatment protocol with a combination of Rig-I-like receptor (RLR) and Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands that induces strong innate immune activation and greatly enhances CD8 T-cell recruitment to the gastric tumors. We propose to study the mechanisms that support intratumoral T-cell accumulation in this model. Specifically, we aim to:•Discover new factors and pathways that foster T-cell migration into tumors•Combine RLR/TLR-based therapy with treatments targeting antitumoral T-cell function to further improve the outcome•Use our expertise in nanoparticle-based drug delivery to augment the specificity of RLR/TLR therapyThe output from this project will lead to a better understanding of how cytotoxic T cells infiltrate gastric tumors and how recruitment of these cells can be induced by pharmacologic intervention.

Successful prevention depends on effective programs of infection control, including detection of transmission events and effective strategies for their containment and prevention. A thorough understanding of the processes underlying the local emergence and spread of MRSA may help in the design of new strategies to counteract this evolution. Knowledge of how MRSA spreads throughout a hospital can be greatly improved by inferring transmission pathways on the basis of genetic relatedness. Traditional typing methodologies suffer from poor levels of discrimination for localized epidemiology, where many cases of infection may be caused by a single outbreak strain. Next generation sequencing (NGS) addresses this by providing the capacity to detect single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the whole genome for a large number of outbreak isolates. The ability to identify the minutiae of genetic changes occurring within a single strain over very short time-scales allows the reconstruction of the phylogeny of a single outbreak, and the potential to identify the original source. In parallel, the sequence data can also potentially reveal clinically relevant phenotypes of the outbreak strain, such as resistance and virulence properties.In this project, we propose to sequence c.a. 500 MRSA isolates from the clone ST-228 recovered from two University Swiss hospitals in Lausanne and Geneva, as well as over its global international distribution. These data will be analyzed in an epidemiological and evolutionary framework in order to investigate the short-term epidemiological evolutionary dynamics during a local outbreak.

Combining of the sequence data with detailed metadata on patient admission and movement confirmed that the outbreak was due to the transmission of a single clonal variant of ST228 rather than repeated introductions of this clone into the hospital. We note that this clone is significantly more frequently recovered from groin and rectal swabs than other clones (P < 0.0001) and is also significantly more transmissible between roommates (P < 0.01). Unrecognized MRSA carriers together with movements of patients within the hospital also seem to have played a major role. These atypical colonization and transmission dynamics can help explain how the outbreak was maintained over the long term. This “stealthy” asymptomatic colonization of the gut combined with heightened transmissibility (potentially reflecting a role for environmental reservoirs) means the dynamics of this outbreak share some properties with enteric pathogens such as vancomycin resistant enterococci or Clostridium difficile.,150029,"Media relations: print media, online media",Du nouveau sur le staphylocoque doré,https://www.planetesante.ch/Magazine/Autour-de-la-maladie/Infections-nosocomiales/Du-nouveau-sur-le-staphylocoque-dore,2016

Untreated eosinophil-predominant inflammation leads to esophageal remodeling with stricture formation and consecutive food bolus impactions with the inherent risks of esophageal perforation. The optimal long-term therapeutic strategy still needs to be defined. Until recently, no standardized instruments for measuring disease activity existed. Since EoE activity was assessed using different non-validated  instruments, discrepancies between severity of symptoms and biologic measures have been described in some, but not in other studies. As such, endpoints for clinical trials and natural history studies could not be defined, and no specific therapies for EoE management have been approved by regulatory authorities in United States and Europe. Furthermore, different stakeholders do not come to an agreement on the therapeutic endpoints to be assessed in clinical trials and observational studies. Under the leadership of the applicants, the international EoE Activity Index (EEsAI) study group developed and validated instruments (questionnaires) that determine EoE symptom severity, quality of life, endoscopic and histologic activity.Objectives: We intend to take full advantage of our expertise in EoE activity assessment to address the following aims in three inter-related projects:Project I: We will identify endpoints (symptom severity, quality of life, endoscopic and histologic activity), which physicians and patients consider relevant for use in clinical trials and observational studies.Project II: We will define cut-off values of the EEsAI instruments scores for categorical disease activity (remission, mild, moderate, and severe disease). Using these definitions, we will examine the relationship between EoE symptom severity, quality of life, endoscopic and histologic activity in adult EoE patients.Project III: We will compare the efficacy of continuous and episodic treatment with oral viscous suspension of budesonide in maintaining clinical remission over a 54-week period in a proof of concept study.Methods: For project I, we will convene an inter-disciplinary working group composed of physicians with EoE expertise, representatives of regulatory authorities and industry. Delphi rounds will be conducted to achieve consensus on the selection of endpoints for clinical trials. The preliminary results will be shared with patients, and their input will be gained using surveys and focus group interviews. This input will be integrated into the final recommendations. In project II, we will define cut-off values of EEsAI scores for categorical disease activity states and examine the relationship between patient-reported outcome measures (symptoms, quality of life) and physician-reported biologic measures (endoscopic and histologic activity) in 250 prospectively included adult EoE patients. The strength of associations will be examined using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient.In project III, we will conduct a randomized, single-blind, non-inferiority trial (proof of concept study) comparing the efficacy of episodic and continuous treatment with oral viscous suspension of budesonide in maintaining clinical remission over a 54-week period. The primary endpoint will be the symptom score. Secondary endpoints will be quality of life score and stricture formation. A margin of 5 will be defined for non-inferiority of the episodic compared to continuous treatment. A total of 80 patients (40 per treatment arm) will be recruited. Analysis will be by intention to treat. The selected endpoints and definitions of categorical disease activity states from project 1 and 2, respectively, will be used to interpret the results.Expected results and importance: The definition of therapeutic endpoints will undoubtedly facilitate the development of much-awaited therapies for EoE management. Furthermore, this project will add new and important evidence from a well-characterized cohort of EoE patients on the relationship between patient reported-outcomes and biologic measures of EoE activity. The results of the randomized trial will be useful in optimizing long-term pharmacological treatment strategies.",Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois Service de Gastro-enterologie et Hépatologie CHUV,Lausanne,553293,0000-0001-6341-9536,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",Switzerland,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),Current concepts in eosinophilic esophagitis,"Simon Dagmar,  Straumann Alex,  Schoepfer Alain M.,  Simon Hans-Uwe",Published,2017,,10.1007/s40629-017-0037-8,http://doi.org/10.1007/s40629-017-0037-8,Allergo Journal International,,Allergo Journal International,26,7,258,266,Allergo Journal International,,Background:     Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a disease entity first described in the 1990s but showing an increasing incidence that is characterized clinically by esophageal dysfunction and histologically by a striking eosinophil infiltration.    Methods:     This article discusses new aspects of the pathogenesis symptoms diagnosis and treatment of EoE.    Results:     EoE affects both children and adults and is frequently associated with atopic disease and IgE sensitization. Barrier dysfunction and T‑helper 2 inflammation are considered to be pathogenetically important factors. Recently a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) sensitive EoE subtype as well as an EoE like disorder have been described.

In the latter half of the 19th Century Darwin explored the roles of natural and sexual selection in driving divergence, and in the early 20th Century the focus shifted to mechanisms that could interrupt gene flow during speciation. At the end of the 20th Century the ability to reconstruct phylogenetic history led to the exploration of the species radiations, and recent work linked niche concepts (time-equilibrium concepts) to evolutionary history (phylogenies, mapping niche variables over phylogenies) and started integrating these into macro-evolutionary concepts like adaptive radiations and biogeography. This led to the realization that global variation in biodiversity may be the consequence not only of environmental variables, but also of evolutionary history. Here we incorporate interspecific interactions into speciation and radiation, by explicitly using communities as the evolutionary arena, as the context for speciation, co-existence and radiation. Populations are the main units that evolve; they expand or decline into extinction in response to biotic and abiotic selection. The evolutionary fate of a species is an epiphenomenon of the evolutionary fates of all its constituent populations. That said, populations are linked by gene flow (plants) and migration (animals). Communities constitute the arena of interaction between populations of different species. This interaction can be mutualistic, facilitative, synergistic, competitive, or predatorial. Every species is part of at least one community, it is filtered into the community by its geographical presence, by its eco-physiological ability to deal with the abiotic conditions in the community, and by its ability to survive the biotic interactions within the community. It interacts with all members in a community through, inter alia, competition for resources (space, light, water, nutrients), facilitation (protection) or mutualism (dispersal, pollination). Membership of a community may be seen as evidence of successful integration. A species which cannot survive in at least one community will go extinct.We explore three phases in the evolution of diversity. The first is speciation, the origination of lineages that have unique evolutionary histories and fates. We explore the contributions of variables that limit gene flow between diverging lineages (allopatry, ploidy change, flowering time shift) and variables that select against intermediates (e.g. failure of intermediates to survive in at least one community) to the increase in genetic divergence among the diverging lineages, in the context of the emerging realization that genomic organisation might facilitate speciation with gene flow. The second is the continued coexistence of the recently diverged lineages, either due to geographical separation (found in the same community, but in different regions), or to niche shifts (either found in different communities in the same region, or occupying different alpha-niches within the same community). The third is the translation of speciation and continued coexistence in communities into macro-evolutionary patterns of diversity. These could be used to interpret historical periods of intense speciation in response to new ecological opportunities, or due to the evolution of key innovations. These leave a trace in community phylogenetics (phylogenetic clustering or overdispersion), and in the divergence patterns (diversification slowdowns). This approach accounts for the differences in alpha, beta and gamma diversity in terms of the speciation and co-existence, and for the patterns of radiation in terms of the number of niches available within a community, the number of communities in a region and the number of regions in the Cape flora.As study group we use the African Restionaceae, a typical element of the hyperdiverse Cape flora. Not only do we already have substantial background information on this family, but it is also suitably species rich. As such it is an excellent model group to explore the integration of pattern and process in diversification.",Institut für Systematische Botanik und Botanischer Garten Universität Zürich,Zürich,131280,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",Switzerland,Peer-reviewed,,Adaptive radiations should not be simplified: The case of the danthonioid grasses,"Linder H.

T-cell derived IFNgamma is a major antiviral effector controlling both hepatitis C virus and hepatitis B virus infection. IFNalpha is being used since 30 years for treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and C (CHC). More recently, IFNlambda4 has been identified as a key regulator of the immune response to HCV. The IFNlambda4 gene exists in two major allelic variants. The ancestral allele encodes a fully functional IFNlambda4. An insertion mutation (changing a G to a TT) disrupts the open reading frame of IFNlambda4. Genome wide association studies discovered a highly significant association of the TT allele with spontaneous clearance of HCV. It is presently unclear why IFNlambda4 is a liability in case of an HCV infection. We hypothesize that IFN?4 negatively regulates the cellular immune response to HCV. In this application, we propose three subprojects that investigate different aspects of the IFN? system in viral hepatitis, with a focus on the specific role of IFN?4 in the host response to HCV.In subproject 1 we will study the biochemistry, physiology, tissue distribution and natural regulation of IFN?4. In subproject 2 we will study the regulation of the IFN? receptor. Contrary to the ubiquitous expression of the IFNa receptor in all cell types and organs, IFN? receptor expression is restricted mainly to epithelial cells. However, its expression can be induced in other cell types such as hepatocytes or dendritic cells. A better understanding of the regulation of IFN? receptor expression should provide important insights into the biological function of the IFN? system. In subproject 3 we plan to identify the IFN? responsive immune cells and to elucidate the cell-cell network and the cytokines involved that regulate the immune response to HCV.Simultaneously with these subprojects focused on the IFN? system, we plan to develop human biopsy derived liver organoids as an experimental model to study inter-individual differences in cellular responses to HCV and HBV in subproject 4. Current in vitro models for HCV and HBV are based on few hepatoma derived cell lines and primary human hepatocytes. Both systems have major limitations. Human liver biopsy derived organoids might overcome some of these limitations. Because they can be derived from individual patients they have a unique potential to enable the study of inter-individual differences in cellular responses to hepatitis viruses.",Abt. für Gastroenterologie und Hepatologie Universitätsspital Basel,Basel,532319,0000-0002-7523-4894,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Research Infrastructures",Switzerland,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Human Th17 cells are a subset of T helper cells that produce IL-17A/F, IL-22 and IL-26 and play a major role in the protection against infections but also in the pathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases such psoriasis. IL17A/F activates the IL17-R expressed by epithelial cells and induces the expression of various CXC chemokines, leading to the recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes to the site of inflammation. IL-22 induces proliferation of epithelial cells and may therefore be involved in epidermal remodeling. IL-26 acts via the IL-10R2/IL-20R1 heterodimeric receptor to induce production of IL-10, TNF-a and IL-8 by epithelial cells but inhibits their proliferation. Although Th17 cells have been extensively studied in the past few years, the exact functions of IL-26 remain to be fully understood. Interestingly, a genetic risk locus containing the IL-26 gene and SNPs within the IL-26 gene region were identified in several autoimmune diseases although it has been unclear how the described functions of IL-26 are in line with the inflammatory roles of Th17 cells.Preliminary data. We found that IL-26 is a highly cationic and amphipathic protein that forms oligomeric structures with the capacity to directly kill extracellular bacteria via membrane pore formation. Furthermore, we found that IL-26 forms complexes with self-DNA released into the extracellular environment by host cells. The resulting IL-26-DNA complexes trigger potent type I IFN production by pDCs by promoting TLR9 activation. These results identify a role for IL-26 as a natural antimicrobial protein that triggers inflammatory responses by promoting immune sensing of host cell death. These data provide a new function of Th17 cells and new understanding on how Th17 exert their antimicrobial role in infection and promote inflammation in autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis. Hypothesis. Based on these findings, we propose that IL-26 is a key cytokine in Th17-mediated skin inflammation. That promotes innate activation of several immune and non-immune cells via intracellular nucleic acid receptors. We also hypothesize that the overproduction of IL-26 by Th17 cells drives chronic skin inflammation the characteristic epidermal phenotype in psoriasisSpecific Aims. We have demonstrated that IL-26-DNA complexes can stimulate pDC through TLR9. In specific Aim 1 we will decipher the different cell types and nucleic acid sensors that can be targeted by IL-26-Nucleic acids complexes In specific Aim 2 we will investigate the factors that regulate IL-26 expression in Th17 cells. Finally, in specific Aim 3 we will investigate whether and how IL-26 can drive the development of psoriasis in vivo.Significance. This study will investigate the functions of IL-26 and investigate their role in triggering skin inflammation. The study will also provide new insights in the mechanism that govern chronic inflammatory skin diseases and potentially deliver new therapeutic targets to treat psoriasis and other related diseases.",Service de Dermatologie Hôpital Beaumont CHUV,Lausanne,78120,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Background: With research supported by the current SNSF grant entitled “Glutamatergic mechanisms in sleep-wake homeostasis in health and disease - molecular brain imaging and pharmacogenetics”, we provided compelling evidence that sleep deprivation induces dynamic increases in the functional availability of metabotropic glutamate receptors of subtype 5 (mGluR5) in the living human brain. The function of mGluR5 is causally associated with the pathophysiology of fragile X syndrome (FXS), a leading inherited cause of intellectual disability and autism. FXS is caused by a massive expansion of (CGG) repeats in the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1), which encodes fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). We found in healthy volunteers that the number of (CGG) repeats (odd vs. even) in FMR1 modulates the availability of mGluR5. Furthermore, mGluR5 availability and distinct behavioral and neurophysiological markers of sleep need and sleep intensity (referred to as sleep homeostasis) are tightly correlated. Interestingly, animal studies demonstrate that mGluR5 functionally interact with Homer1, a core molecular marker of sleep homeostasis. Our findings, thus, strongly suggest that mGluR5 availability and expression of FMRP may determine individual sleep need in humans.2. Specific Aims: These hypotheses will now be tested using multi-modal imaging with simultaneous positron emission tomography and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy scanning of mGluR5 availability and metabolite levels (e.g., glutamate and glutamine) in the brain, as well as measuring the FMRP concentration in peripheral blood in baseline, during sleep deprivation and after recovery sleep. Established biomarkers of sleep homeostasis in electroencephalographic oscillations (number, amplitudes, slopes) in wakefulness and sleep will be quantified through algorithms established in our lab. The exact roles of mGluR5 in subjective and behavioral consequences of individual differences in sleep need will be assessed through investigation of a novel negative allosteric modulator of mGluR5 (dipraglurant).3. Specific Hypotheses: (1) mGluR5 and FMRP modulate wake-related neuronal plasticity and contribute to the homeostatic build-up of sleep need in wakefulness. (2) Selective, negative allosteric modulation of mGluR5 mimics a physiological attenuation in sleep pressure, including changes in subjective and neurobehavioral state. (3) The mGluR5 may provide a novel target system to improve sleep-wake disturbances and sleep-associated brain functions.4. Experimental Design and Methods: Complementary neurophysiological, imaging, genetic, neurocognitive, behavioral, and pharmacological methods will be employed (controlled, within-subject designs), to investigate whether the mGluR5/FMRP are molecular regulators of sleep-wake homeostasis in humans.5. Expected Value of the Proposed Project: We expect that the proposed integrative physiological studies in humans, including multi-modal molecular brain imaging and pharmacogenetics, will show causal relationships among mGluR5 function, homeostatic sleep-wake regulation, and sleep-wake related neuronal plasticity. Our interdisciplinary team brings together complementary expertise along a ‘molecule-to-human-to-medicine’ continuum, which may lead to novel insights into pathophysiological underpinnings of sleep-wake related disorders.",Institut für Pharmakologie und Toxikologie Universität Zürich,Zürich,42687,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication;Research Infrastructures",Switzerland,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),Unraveling the genetic underpinnings of sleep deprivation-induced impairments in human cognition,"Satterfield Brieann C.,  Stucky Benjamin,  Landolt Hans-Peter,  Van Dongen Hans P.A.",Published,2019,9780444642509,10.1016/bs.pbr.2019.03.026,https://www.zora.uzh.ch/,Progress in Brain Research,"Elsevier,",Progress in Brain Research,246,,127,158,Progress in Brain Research,,The biobehavioral phenomena of sleep and cognition involve complex phenotype genotype associations i.e. complex relationships between observable traits and the genetic variants that contribute to the expression of those traits. There is a general belief that investigating such relationships requires large sample sizes. However sleep  and cognition related phenotype genotype associations may be strengthened through carefully controlled laboratory studies that amplify a given cognitive phenotype by perturbing the biobehavioral system through sleep deprivation and/or pharmacogenetic interventions. Utilization of performance tasks that dissociate cognitive processes allows for cognitive endophenotyping that is making precise measurements that capture the essence of a cognitive phenotype.– This enables assessment of the genetic underpinnings of cognitive impairment due to sleep deprivation without necessarily requiring large samples. Theory driven gene selection selective population sampling techniques to avoid underrepresentation of rare genetic variants and modern statistical techniques informed by prior knowledge further enhance statistical power. Here we illustrate these approaches on the basis of recent findings supplemented with some new results as well as a discussion of modern regression methods for statistical analysis. Ongoing research employing these methods is driving advancements in the understanding of the genetic underpinnings of cognitive impairment associated with sleep loss.,163439,Talks/events/exhibitions,Aktuelle Herausforderungen in der Schlafforschung,http://www.naturwissenschaften.ch/organisations/ang,2017

It is however well recognized that effective and efficient evidence-based interventions adapted to the primary care setting are lacking. The AGE program (Active Geriatric Evaluation) was launched in 2011 and aimed at developing a comprehensive assessment and management tool (CAMT) for GP’s to better identify and manage geriatric syndromes. The CAMT is composed of a 20-minute clinical screening instrument (Brief Assessment Tool, BAT), which performances for identifying geriatric syndromes was already assessed in general practice along the AGE program, and a comprehensive approach that encompasses: complementary diagnostic evaluations and propositions of management & treatment for each syndrome. The efficacy and efficiency of the CAMT for preventing functional decline was never assessed in real life settings of general practice.

The impact of obesity on cancer is a major public health concern because of the large and growing pandemic proportion of obesity. In addition obesity is a negative prognostic factor with impact on cancer treatments and outcome. For the future it will be of the utmost importance to identify cancer treatments specifically tailored for overweight and obese patients. In spite of the clinical relevance, the mechanism by which obesity promotes cancer initiation and progression remains largely elusive. Although cancer initiation and progression requires the activation of tumor promoting genes (oncogenes) and the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes through genetic and epigenetic events, additional factors within the host provide an important and some times essential contribution to tumorigenesis. Bone marrow-derived inflammatory cells newly recruited at the tumor site and resident leukocytes are instrumental to inflammatory events contributing to tumor initiation and progression. The formation of a tumor-associated vasculature, a process also know as tumor angiogenesis, facilitates primary tumor growth and metastasis formation. In this project three established investigators, Pr C. Rüegg, Dr. G. Solinas and Pr V. Djonov with related but complementary research interests and expertise are joining forces to investigate host-dependent mechanisms of obesity-mediated tumor initiation and promotion. PI3K-Akt is a critical signaling node in mechanisms modulating metabolism, obesity, inflammation, angiogenesis and cancer relevant to obesity-mediated tumor promotion. In this project we will generate and use mice lacking three different isozymes of PI3K (beta, gamma, delta) in hematopoietic/inflammatory and endothelial cells, to test the role of these PI3K isozymes in obesity mediated promotion of hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer progression and metastasis, and intussusceptive angiogenesis. The specific subprojects are:1) Investigating the role of PI3K signaling in obesity-mediated promotion of hepatocellular carcinoma (Solinas)2) Role of class-1 PI3K signaling within hematopoietic and endothelial cells in obesity-mediated breast cancer progression (Rüegg)2) Intussusceptive angiogenesis - an alternative way of blood vessel formation in obesity driven tumor initiation and progression (Djonov)We envisage that results obtained in this project will have important implications toward a better understanding of the mechanisms of cancer initiation and progression, which may be fundamental to better tumor prevention or cancer treatment for overweight and obese individuals.

Blood pressure is critically dependent on Na+ handling by the kidney. As important is K+ homeostasis that is regulated in concert with Na+, as changes of its plasma concentration cause severe disturbances of skeletal and cardiac muscle functions and cause life-threatening troubles such as cardiac arrhythmias. The kidney achieves Na+ homeostasis by the regulated reabsorption of filtered Na+ during its passage through the nephron, whereas K+ is secreted in a controlled manner in the distal nephron, driven by the concomitant electrogenic reabsorption of Na+. There are 3 apically located transporters/channels, which are playing a crucial role in Na+ reabsorption, including the Na+,K+,2Cl--transporter NKCC2, the Na+,Cl--cotransporter NCC, and the epithelial Na+ channel ENaC. This is evidenced by the genetic association of these proteins with monogenic gain- or loss of function diseases that all strongly disturb Na+ and K+ balance as well as blood pressure. The main hormone controlling these processes is aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid hormone, which is secreted under two different conditions: 1) when blood volume is low (hypovolemia) via the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) to promote Na+ and fluid reabsorption, without affecting K+ secretion, 2) when plasma K+ is high (hyperkalemia),  causing independently of the RAAS K+ secretion without major effect on Na+ reabsorption. This phenomenon, referred to as the aldosterone paradox, is still not very well understood. We and many others have collected strong evidence that the ubiquitin-protein ligase NEDD4-2 and SGK1 are major players in these processes, by regulating NCC and ENaC. Excitingly, we have now new data suggesting that NEDD4-2 also controls NKCC2. Moreover, we have been able to identify by a proteomic approach, specific ubiquitylation sites both on endogenous NCC and NKCC2 in the kidney. Finally, we have identified a novel aldosterone-induced kinase, PIM-3, which may also contribute to this regulatory network. We therefore postulate that: Ubiquitylation by NEDD4-2 is a major mechanism controlling Na+ and K+ homeostasis in the kidney, via ubiquitylation on specific sites of Na+ transporters/channels such as NKCC2, NCC or ENaC. Its activity is controlled by complex phosphorylation cascades, including SGK1 and PIM3. Specific aims:1) To study the molecular mechanisms of ubiquitylation in the control of NCC and NKCC22) To evaluate the role of aldosterone-induced PIM3 kinase in the turnover of MR and in the regulation of Na+ absorption in the ASDNMethods: Heterologous expression in Hek293 cells, oocytes and renal epithelial cells.

There is, therefore, a pressing need for new breakthroughs in this field. AKI in humans is often multi-factorial; most research has focused on ischaemia-reperfusion injury, but toxin induced injury is arguably a more relevant experimental model. A wide variety of drugs cause AKI and this limits the usage of otherwise effective agents. Mitochondria in the proximal tubule (PT) are typically the targets of toxicity, but in most cases the mechanisms are unknown, due to a lack of methods to study this. Mitochondria are complex and dynamic organelles, frequently interacting via fission and fusion events, and are thus thought to exist in functional networks rather than as isolated entities. Mitochondrial mass within cells is constantly turned over by a combination of selective autophagy (mitophagy) and proliferation. Mitochondrial function, dynamics and turnover are increasingly viewed as being inextricably linked, and as potential targets for therapeutic manipulation to limit or reverse cellular damage in AKI. We have developed intravital imaging techniques - using multiphoton microscopy - that allow detailed assessment of mitochondrial structure, function and dynamics in PT cells in living rodents. We are using this approach to make new insights into how mitochondria respond in real time to insults in models of AKI. Aims and objectivesIn this proposal we aim to further elucidate the pathogenesis of AKI, by investigating how mitochondria respond dynamically to disease causing toxins in kidney cells. To achieve these aims, we will use a variety of cutting-edge techniques (including intravital imaging) and both cell and animal models that realistically reflect human AKI.We envisage that this work will not only increase knowledge concerning an important, topical and poorly understood clinical problem (toxin induced kidney disease), but will also provide more general insights into mitochondrial biology of likely relevance to other forms of AKI. Furthermore, it should aid the rational development of mitochondrial-targeted therapies in the longer term.",Anatomisches Institut Universität Zürich,Zürich,510201,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results",Switzerland,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, despite initial responses to cancer therapy, resistance of primary or disseminated tumors eventually emerges, which minimizes therapeutic options and greatly reduces survival. The molecular mechanisms underlying this therapy escape are mostly unclear.In this project we aim to identify novel mechanisms that underlie poor drug responses in tumors with defects in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway due to an irreversible BRCA2 inactivation. We will focus on the inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) using olaparib or AZD2461. Both of these PARP inhibitors induce synthetic lethality of BRCA2-deficient tumor cells with only little side effects for the host. To study basic mechanisms of therapy escape we will use a genetically engineered mouse model for BRCA2-deficient breast cancer, which closely mimics the disease found in humans. Similar to the situation in cancer patients, we observe that cancer cells in these mice can escape the deadly effects of classical chemotherapy, or PARP inhibition. Thus, the resistance models that we have established provide a unique opportunity to explore therapy escape mechanisms.Intriguingly, in some resistant tumors we found restoration of RAD51 foci formation, which strongly suggests BRCA2-independent restoration of HR. This finding is unexpected, since it is generally assumed that RAD51 loading requires the presence of BRCA2 in mammalian cells. We will explore the underlying mechanisms of resistance by synergizing the advantages of next generation sequencing of tumors with functional genomic screens in cell lines derived from our model.My hope is that the basic knowledge obtained in this project will yield useful information for designing effective approaches to circumvent or reverse therapy escape in human cancer patients.",Institute of Animal Pathology  University of Bern,Bern,123095,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",United States of America,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,156869,"Media relations: print media, online media",Weniger Tierversuche dank Uni-Bern-Forscher,,2017

Though management of NHL has witnessed significant improvements, on a EU scale it is estimated that ~190,000 subjects still die from lymphoma each year (3% of all deaths, and ~35% of deaths from hematological cancers). The World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumours of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues recognizes splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) as a distinct clinico-pathologic entity. Though SMZL shares an indolent disease course, it still remains incurable disorder and no consensus exists about the best therapies. The current treatments for SMZL are initially effective in inducing responses in most patients, but they are not curative and show decreasing efficacy with repeated administrations, ultimately resulting in the selection of a chemoresistant clone or in transformation into an aggressive lymphoma. In addition, chemotherapy-based regimens are associated with short and long-term toxic effects, including cumulative myelosuppression, neuropathy, cardiac toxicity, and secondary cancers. Toward the aim of eradicating the disease with the minimum load of toxic effect, the new treatment scenarios of lymphomas will include chemotherapy-free approaches based on the pharmacological inhibition of the pathways to which the disease is addicted. Modern advances in genomics and cancer biology, including our own studies, have produced an unprecedented body of knowledge regarding the molecular pathogenesis of and B-cell lymphoma. In particular, studies performed by the applicants and by others have disclosed a number of cellular pathways that are deregulated in SMZL including NOTCH signalling and NFKB pathway. In parallel to these biological advances, several new classes of molecularly targeted agents have been developed with varying degrees of efficacy across the different types of mature B-cell tumors. In general, the development of new drugs for treating B-cell lymphoma has been mostly empiric, with a limited knowledge of the molecular target, its involvement in the disease, and the effect of the drug on the selection of resistant mutations. Thus, the variability observed in clinical responses likely results from underlying molecular heterogeneity. In the era of personalized medicine, the challenge for the treatment of patients with B-cell lymphoma will involve correctly matching a molecularly targeted therapy to the unique genetics of each individual tumor.  Through the use of innovative tools and approaches for the generation of biomedical data, including '-omics', high throughput, the project will address three major unmet clinical needs in the field of new targeted drugs treatment of SMZL, and of other B-cell lymphomas as well, namely: i) unraveling molecular mechanisms of resistance to new compounds that are in clinical development; ii) identifying accessible and highly sensitive biomarkers for the early detection of targeted drug resistance in patients; and iii) developing of targeted drug combinations to overcome the entire tumor and avoid the selection of resistant clones. The ultimate goal of the project is making biomarker-driven personalized medicine a reality in the management of B-cell lymphoma.A fast and efficient transferability to the clinical setting of the results of this project will be granted by i) the multidisciplinary attitudes of the applicants; ii) the vocation of IOSI to the early clinical development of new anti-cancer treatments; iii) the interconnection of the applicants with a multi-institutional research network in the field of CLL and other B-cell tumors; and iv) the tight collaboration of the applicants with Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK) and the International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group (IELSG).",Istituto oncologico di ricerca (IOR) Facoltà di scienze biomedice,Bellinzona,524354,0000-0001-5637-8983,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication;Research Infrastructures",Italy,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL PRECLINICAL MODELS OF SECONDARY RESISTANCE TO THE PI3KΔ INHIBITOR IDELALISIB IN SPLENIC MARGINAL ZONE LYMPHOMA (SMZL),"Arribas A.J.,  Gaudio E.,  Rinaldi A.,  Cascione L.,  Tarantelli C.,  Kwee I.,  Stathis A.,  Zucca E.,  Rossi D.,  Bertoni F.",Published,2017,,10.1002/hon.2438_119,,Hematological Oncology,,Hematological Oncology,35,,254,254,Hematological Oncology,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, physical, biogeochemical and biological factors superimpose structure onto pelagic habitats at various spatial and temporal scales. This heterogeneity may be relevant for bacterial assemblages in the productive surface water layers, as it mediates the co-existence of genotypes with contrasting growth strategies. For example, motile and non-motile bacterioplankton populations could have different ecophysiological adaptations to locally variable substrate levels. Motile cells track gradients of organic compounds; they are thus expected to interpret a rise of substrate concentrations as a signal for increasingly favourable growth conditions, and to rapidly undergo general metabolic up-regulation. By contrast, non-motile bacteria are passively exposed to stochastic change of the substrate field from which they cannot predict future growth conditions. They should thus exhibit a much more limited physiological response to substrate heterogeneity. However, also non-motile bacteria should be well-adapted to thrive in a variable substrate field, e.g., by a permanent ‘preparedness’ to rapidly incorporate substrates across concentrations ranges that match environmental fluctuations.Dissolved free amino acids (DFAA) are highly favourable for the growth of many microbial taxa in aquatic systems; thus they are only available at low nanomolar concentrations. Due to the tight coupling between DFAA consumption and release, they qualify as sensitive tracers for exploring the heterogeneous substrate field experienced by free-living aquatic bacteria. DFAA patterns can be determined in less than a millilitre of lake water, allowing for high spatial resolution by appropriate sampling approaches. The proposed project will investigate the extent of substrate variability at the meso- (cm) to macroscale (m, km), and its consequences on the growth patterns of sympatric free-living bacterioplankton populations. We shall chart the heterogeneity of DFAA in Lake Zurich at different spatiotemporal scales and analyse its relatedness to biotic and abiotic factors. This will provide an ecologically meaningful framework for performing pulse addition experiments with DFAA, to test the hypothesis that motile and non-motile bacterial taxa differ in their respective metabolic responses. We shall obtain metagenomic information from these experiments to distinguish between populations with and without genes for motility, and subsequently map metatranscriptomic data onto these populations. In parallel, we will assess motility, compare the substrate uptake velocity of different bacterioplankton taxa, and determine to which extent the transport of DFAA into cells is upregulated by prior exposure.",Limnologische Station Universität Zürich,Kilchberg ZH,524256,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Research Infrastructures",Switzerland,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),Strain-specific consumption and transformation of alga-derived dissolved organic matter by members of the Limnohabitans -C and Polynucleobacter -B clusters of Betaproteobacteria,"Horňák Karel,  Kasalický Vojtěch,  Šimek Karel,  Grossart Hans-Peter",Published,2017,,10.1111/emi.2017.19.issue-11,,Environmental Microbiology,,Environmental Microbiology,19,11,4519,4535,Environmental Microbiology,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In our previous SNF grant, we have demonstrated that autoantibodies directed against apolipoprotein A-1 (anti-ApoA-1 IgG) are (i) more prevalent in high CV risk populations, (ii) associated with vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques, (iii) independent predictors of poor cardiovascular outcome, and iv) targeted to the c-terminal part of apoA-1. We also provided evidence that rather than being simply biomarkers for CVD, anti-apoA-1 IgG are likely to play a direct pathogenic role as pro-inflammatory and pro-arrhythmogenic mediators, acting through specific cellular pathways, inducing increased atherogenesis, atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability and mortality in mice. Finally, we have designed and chemically synthesized c-ter ApoA-1 fragment that (i) recapitulates the predictive value of intact ApoA-1 in anti-ApoA-1 IgG detection immunoassays and (ii) is capable of reversing the pro-inflammatory and pro-arrhythmogenic effects of anti-ApoA-1 IgG in vitro. Hypotheses: 1. Antibodies against the C-terminal alpha-helix of apoA-1 (c-ter anti-ApoA-1 IgG) represent a new CV risk factor whose detection would provide significant benefit in primary prevention of CVD. 2. c-ter anti-ApoA-1 IgG play a direct role in the pathogenesis of CV diseases and therefore represent potential new targets for clinical preventative and therapeutic interventions.3. c-ter apoA-1 mimetic peptides have the potential to reverse the deleterious effect of ApoA-1 IgG-mediated CV disease.Specific aims:1.Assess the levels, the environmental/genetic determinants and the prognostic validity of c-ter anti-ApoA-1 IgG levels for CVD in a healthy population using the CoLaus cohort.2.Further develop and optimize c-ter ApoA-1-derived peptides for use in both detection assays and therapy for anti-ApoA-1 IgG-mediated CVD.Experimental Design and Methods: The cardiovascular prognostic values of c-ter anti-ApoA-1 IgG in primary prevention will be assessed on the CoLaus cohort (n=6700).

Perinatal asphyxia is known to be one of the major causes of newborn mortality or long term neurological deficits, and the only approved treatment is moderate hypothermia. The development of a clinically safe and effective neuroprotectant is still an unmet goal in newborn cerebral hypoxia/ischemia (HI). One explanation of the failure to find appropriate and efficient neuroprotective strategies in clinically relevant HI situations is that a multiplicity of cell death mechanisms are involved. Thus, inhibiting the best-known pathways, such as apoptosis, is insufficient, because other less well known cell death mechanisms are still active. In view of the need to understand alternative cell death pathways, we and others have recently proposed a new mechanism involved in neuronal death after cerebral ischemia, which is an abnormally elevated activation of (macro)autophagy. Autophagy is an essential physiological degradation process by which the cell eliminates damaged organelles, toxic agents and long lived proteins in lysosomes. However, we have recently shown both in vitro and in vivo that in hypoxic/excitotoxic and apoptotic conditions, autophagy is strongly enhanced and that its inhibition (by pharmacological or genetical means) provides strong neuroprotection. These results suggest that autophagy inhibition should be considered as an important target for the development of neuroprotective strategies against neonatal cerebral HI. Thus, the overall aim of this project is to contribute to the understanding of how enhanced autophagy mediates neuronal death in neonatal cerebral HI. Working hypotheses: 1) Enhanced autophagy and oxidative stress are linked in the mediation of hypoxic/excitotoxic neuronal death. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) may enhance autophagy and increased autophagy may contribute to the generation of ROS. 2) Enhanced autophagy acts upstream of mitochondrial permeabilization as a mediator of neuronal apoptosis. 3) Cardiac glycosides, a new class of autophagy inhibitors, act on autophagy through the SRC pathway.  Projects: A) Investigating the relationships between enhanced neuronal autophagy and oxidative stress occurring in excitotoxic/hypoxic conditions: Project A will determine how enhanced autophagy occurring in hypoxic/excitotoxic conditions could interact with oxidative stress. Since oxidative stress is one of the major mediators of neuronal death in neonatal cerebral HI, we will determine whether enhanced autophagy is activated by and/or contributes to ROS generation. B) Identification of connections between enhanced neuronal autophagy and apoptosis: Project B will investigate where and how in the apoptotic cascade enhanced autophagy affects the apoptotic response. We will determine whether enhanced autophagy contributes to the mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and will investigate whether the autophagosome is a platform for activation/induction of apoptotic mediators. C) Understanding the neuroprotective effect of cardiac glycosides after neonatal cerebral hypoxia/ischemia: Project C aims to investigate the powerful neuroprotection mediated by cardiac glycosides in neonatal cerebral HI. We have recently shown that cardiac glycosides are potent inhibitors of a form of autophagic cell death called autosis. We will clarify: 1) the effect of cardiac glycosides on Na+/K+ ATPase; 2) the role played by the Na+/K+ ATPase downstream pathway SRC; and 3) possible connections with the autophagy pathway. Each part of the project will be done both in vitro in cortical neuron cultures and in vivo in a rat model of neonatal asphyxia. Then, some of the revealed mechanisms will be also tested by retrospective analysis in the brains of asphyxiated human neonates. Expected value of the research: The involvement of autophagy in neuronal death is a relative new field of research with many unanswered questions. By clarifying how enhanced autophagy occurring in neonatal HI mediates neuronal death, this project will help in understanding the dark side of autophagy. Since autophagy is an important physiological process, this project will clarify which part of the autophagic pathway should be targeted, and how, in order to develop efficient and safe neuroprotective strategies based on autophagy inhibition.",Département des neurosciences fondamentales Faculté de Biologie et de Médecine Université de Lausanne,Lausanne,528420,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",United States of America,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy (3rd edition),"Klionsky Daniel J,  Abdelmohsen Kotb,  Abe Akihisa,  Abedin Md Joynal,  Abeliovich Hagai,  Acevedo Arozena Abraham,  Adachi Hiroaki,  Adams Christopher M,  Adams Peter D,  Adeli Khosrow,  Adhihetty Peter J,  Adler Sharon G,  Agam Galila,  Agarwal Rajesh,  Aghi Manish K,  Agnello Maria,  Agostinis Patrizia,  Aguilar Patricia V,  Aguirre-Ghiso Julio,  Airoldi Edoardo M,  Ait-Si-Ali Slimane,  Akematsu Takahiko,  Akporiaye Emmanuel T,  Al-Rubeai Mohamed,  et al.",Published,2016,,10.1080/15548627.2015.1100356,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15548627.2015.1100356?src=recsys,Autophagy,,Autophagy,12,1,1,222,Autophagy,,In 2008 we published the first set of guidelines for standardizing  research in autophagy. Since then research on this topic  has continued to accelerate and many new scientists have  entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies  have also been expanding. Accordingly it is important  to update these guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different  organisms. Various reviews have described the range of  assays that have been used for this purpose. Nevertheless there  continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to  measure autophagy especially in multicellular eukaryotes.  For example a key point that needs to be emphasized is that  there is a difference between measurements that monitor the numbers  or volume of autophagic elements (e.g. autophagosomes or  autolysosomes) at any stage of the autophagic process versus those  that measure flux through the autophagy pathway (i.e. the complete  process including the amount and rate of cargo sequestered  and degraded). In particular a block in macroautophagy that  results in autophagosome accumulation must be differentiated  from stimuli that increase autophagic activity defined as increased  autophagy induction coupled with increased delivery to and degradation  within lysosomes (inmost higher eukaryotes and some protists  such as Dictyostelium) or the vacuole (in plants and fungi). In  other words it is especially important that investigators new to the  field understand that the appearance of more autophagosomes  does not necessarily equate with more autophagy. In fact in many  cases autophagosomes accumulate because of a block in trafficking  to lysosomes without a concomitant change in autophagosome  biogenesis whereas an increase in autolysosomes may reflect a  reduction in degradative activity. It is worth emphasizing here that  lysosomal digestion is a stage of autophagy and evaluating its competence  is a crucial part of the evaluation of autophagic flux or  complete autophagy.  Here we present a set of guidelines for the selection and  interpretation of methods for use by investigators who aim to  examine macroautophagy and related processes as well as for  reviewers who need to provide realistic and reasonable critiques  of papers that are focused on these processes. These guidelines  are not meant to be a formulaic set of rules because the appropriate  assays depend in part on the question being asked and  the system being used. In addition we emphasize that no individual  assay is guaranteed to be the most appropriate one in  every situation and we strongly recommend the use of multiple  assays to monitor autophagy. Along these lines because of the  potential for pleiotropic effects due to blocking autophagy  through genetic manipulation it is imperative to target by gene  knockout or RNA interference more than one autophagyrelated  protein. In addition some individual Atg proteins or  groups of proteins are involved in other cellular pathways  implying that not all Atg proteins can be used as a specific  marker for an autophagic process. In these guidelines we consider  these various methods of assessing autophagy and what  information can or cannot be obtained from them. Finally by  discussing the merits and limits of particular assays we hope to  encourage technical innovation in the field.,163064,"Media relations: radio, television",Le Nobel de médecine pour l'usine de recyclage de nos cellules ,http://pages.rts.ch/la-1ere/programmes/cqfd/04-10-2016#8029039,2016

Kinases transfer the phosphate groups to specific target proteins. Addition of a phosphate group may affect the activity or the ability of the substrate to interact with other proteins. Phosphatase activity is directly opposite to kinase activity and removes phosphate groups from target proteins reversing its effects. In agreement with the large number of processes regulated by protein phosphorylation the Arabidopsis genome accounts for an estimated 1160 kinases. However, surprisingly few predicted kinases (around a dozen) are present in chloroplasts. The best studied of these kinases are STN7 and STN8 implicated in state transition and D1 repair at the thylakoid membrane and thus function to optimize photosynthetic activity at the protein level. In contrast, the non-typical ABC1-like kinases (ABC1Ks) in chloroplasts reside on lipid droplets (plastoglobules, PG) and function to optimize photosynthesis by modifying the neutral lipid composition of the thylakoid membrane. This includes key electron transporters (plastoquinone and phylloquinone), antioxidants (tocopherols) and photoprotectants (carotenoids). This project aims at unraveling the ABC1K phosphoprotein network using state of the art techniques including phosphoproteomics using the Chlorophos 1.0 peptide chip covering the known chloroplast phosphoproteome and lipidomics to analyze the downstream effects of target phosphorylation. The question whether the prototypical ABC1-like is itself a target of kinase regulation will be addressed. By analyzing the known ABC1K target, tocopherol cyclase (VTE1) we will determine whether phosphorylation affects activity of the enzyme or its attachment to its site of action, the lipid droplets. The effects of ABC1K activity on lipid droplet protein and lipid composition will also be determined. The results will give important insight in the activity of the major group of chloroplast kinases and give way to translation into crop plants such as tomato.",Laboratoire de Physiologie Végétale Institut de biologie Université de Neuchâtel,Neuchâtel 9,18671,0000-0001-6409-5043,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication;Research Infrastructures;Exchange of personnel",Germany,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

At the same time, protein misfolding and aggregation pose severe threats to the health of cells and organisms. Protein folding in vivo is therefore closely guided by molecular chaperones, which interact with substrate polypeptides to increase folding yields, resolve misfolding, or transport them to a target location. Despite the availability of many high-resolution crystal structures of chaperones in their substrate-free apo forms, structural information about how substrates are bound by chaperones and thus protected from misfolding and aggregation is sparse. Consequently, the structural determinants for chaperone functions are still very poorly understood. This lack of information is particularly remarkable, because chaperone functions are essential in all kingdoms of life. Due to the disordered nature of unfolded and partially folded substrates and the highly dynamic ways of interaction between chaperones and substrates, solution NMR spectroscopy is ideally suited to characterize these interactions. Here, we propose to characterize conformation and dynamics of selected chaperone-substrate systems at the atomic level. These studies will contribute to recognizing fundamental principles of chaperone function. We will then apply our experience to characterize the functionally highly related, eukaryotic unfolded protein response (UPR) at the atomic level. In particular, we will pursue three projects A-C:Project A: Molecular determinants of Skp chaperone function. We have previously obtained a complete description of the chaperone Skp in complex with its aggregation-prone substrate OmpX. The dynamic conformational ensemble of the substrate randomly populates a spherical volume in first order approximation. However, additional data show that this ensemble contains non-random substructures. We will now characterize these substructures at the atomic level and compare them with preparations of the Omp in aqueous solution. We will thus be able to directly observe the effect that Skp-binding has on an aggregation-prone substrate. Furthermore, we will determine the contributions of two structural features of Skp on its function: Its symmetry and its cavity, resulting from homooligomerization. Project B: Molecular determinants of Spy chaperone function. The recently discovered periplasmic chaperone Spy presents an ideal model system to study the interaction of a holdase chaperone with both soluble and non-soluble substrates. An atomic resolution description of Spy function is lacking. We will characterize structure and dynamics of the chaperone Spy in its complexes with the soluble Im7 and the insoluble OmpX at the atomic level. We will also investigate how the Spy chaperone distinguishes between folded and unfolded segments of its substrates. Furthermore, we will search for a structural explanation for the Superspy variants. These are single point-mutants of Spy that have been created by directed evolution, leading to increased chaperone activity. Defining the mechanism for a generally enhanced chaperone activity would undoubtedly be very valuable in understanding chaperone action.Project C: Mechanisms for substrate recognition in the eukaryotic UPR system. The endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) contains a signaling system that recognizes unfolded protein in the ER lumen (unfolded protein response; UPR). The UPR is of high relevance for eukaryotic life and its malfunction or overload is involved in metabolic diseases including diabetes and cancer. Its functional mechanism remains however poorly understood. We hypothesize that the basic biophysical principles underlying holdase chaperone function are related to mechanisms of UPR function. We want to reconstitute relevant parts of the UPR system in vitro and reveal the mechanism of unfolded protein by the UPR structurally and functionally.",Abteilung Strukturbiologie und Biophysik Biozentrum Universität Basel,Basel,116217,0000-0002-6709-4684,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",Singapore,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,166426,Talks/events/exhibitions,Jahrestreffen Mittelschulen,,2018

We now know that great apes and perhaps other primates do too. In humans, an individual’s set of learned skills and perhaps learning ability itself are largely developmentally constructed under the influence of social inputs. The cultural intelligence hypothesis builds on these observations and predicts that individual apes exposed to a greater abundance of opportunities for social learning and socially guided exploration during development should have larger sets of learned skills and be more innovative. We have tested this hypothesis for Sumatran and Bornean orangutans in the wild and in sanctuaries and zoos, and confirmed the predictions concerning set of learned skills and exploration behavior. In addition, although we could not yet demonstrate the difference in learning ability in the wild, we did find that Sumatran orangutans in captivity showed greater learning ability. However, all wild orangutans were highly novelty averse, whereas those in sanctuaries and zoos were novelty keen. In the follow-up study we focus on three major questions. First, we will test the predictions on learning ability using newly designed field experiments. Second, we will test the hypothesis that ecological crises lead to greater exploration and innovation. In particular, we will study the exploration, skill sets and diets of newly reintroduced orangutans, living in different habitats from the ones they grew up in, with those of established wild populations. And third, we will test the evolutionary consequences of the cultural intelligence hypothesis, by asking whether intelligent species are also always cultural species.",Institut für Evolutionsbiologie und Umweltwissenschaften Universität Zürich,Zürich,515235,0000-0001-5738-4509,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",Germany,Peer-reviewed,Review article (peer-reviewed),The reluctant innovator: orang-utans and the phylogeny of creativity,"van Schaik C.,  Burkart J.,  Damerius L.,  Forss S.,  Koops K.,  van Noordwijk M.,  Schuppli C.",Published,2016,,,,Philosophical Transactions Royal Society B,,Philosophical Transactions Royal Society B,371,,20150183,,Philosophical Transactions Royal Society B,,,160363,"Media relations: print media, online media",Captive Orangutans Are Curious (But Wild Ones Are Not),https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/03/captivity-unlocks-curiosity-in-orangutans/554813/,2018

The proposed project will help define the most cost-effective dog mass vaccination strategies for rabies elimination in Africa and Asia. Rabies is a zoonotic disease that is responsible for substantial human mortality in Asia and Africa, but recent studies have suggested that elimination is possible.  We hypothesize that the population level aspects of vaccination coverage contribute more to the dynamics of dog rabies elimination than the kinetics of protective antibodies within individual dogs; and that the transmission of dog rabies is density dependent below a threshold of 100 dogs per km2.Approach: In 2012 and 2013 we vaccinated 18,200 and 20,000 dogs in N’Djaména, Chad, reaching a population coverage of more than 70%. Dog rabies incidence dropped from one rabid dog per week prior to the mass vaccination to less than one rabid dog in eight months afterwards. The last rabid dog was recorded in January 2014.  Because of the multiple scales (between dogs and within dogs) in rabies transmission and immune dynamics, this unique data set will be used for comparative mathematical modeling approaches with individual based (contact networks and machine learning) and population-based models. First, we use dog to dog and dog to human contact network data, collected by observational studies, to extrapolate individual dog contact networks to a citywide contact network as a basis for rabies transmission models. Next we will develop metapopulation models that extend an existing compartmental model into 4 or 5 interconnected sub-models, based on the spatial heterogeneity of dog populations in N’Djaména, with assumptions of both frequency-dependent and density-dependent contact rates. Finally we will develop an individual dog based machine learning model and simulate the kinetics of protective antibodies in new populations. The three sets of models will be calibrated to existing data from the previous vaccination campaigns and compared by goodness of fit measures that evaluate parsimony and determine best fitting models (and model assumptions). The models will be used to predict the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns at various frequencies and coverage levels in preventing rabies epidemics due to imported cases. These predictions can then be validated against numbers of any new dog and human rabies cases through the project duration. Expected results and societal impact: This project will generate new knowledge on dog rabies transmission dynamics and potential for elimination; provide advice on optimal vaccination strategies; and identify the most realistic and parsimonious models for the follow-up of forthcoming dog mass vaccination campaigns in Africa and Asia in the framework of the Global Alliance for Rabies Control (GARC).

Two consecutive dog vaccination campaigns took place in Chad in 2012 and 2013 (coverage of 71 in both years) in the capital city of N’Djaména as previously published. We developed a deterministic model of dog human rabies transmission fitted to weekly incidence data of rabid dogs and exposed human cases in N’Djaména. Our analysis showed that the effective reproductive number that is the number of new dogs infected by a rabid dog fell to below one through November 2014. The modeled incidence of human rabies exposure fell to less than one person per million people per year. A phylodynamic estimation of the effective reproductive number from 29 canine rabies virus genetic sequences of the viral N protein confirmed the results of the deterministic transmission model implying that rabies transmission between dogs was interrupted for 9 months. However new dog rabies cases appeared earlier than the transmission and phylodynamic models predicted. This may have been due to the continuous movement of rabies exposed dogs into N’Djaména from outside the city. Our results show that canine rabies transmission to humans can be interrupted in an African city with currently available dog rabies vaccines provided that the vaccination area includes larger adjacent regions and local communities are informed and engaged.,160067,"Media relations: print media, online media",Die Tollwut könnte weltweit ausgerottet werden,,2017

Therapies directed at blocking glucagon action as well as mimicking GLP-1 clearly improve glycemic control in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients as well as in rodent diabetic models. Thus understanding proglucagon-cell functions in diabetes is critical and could provide substantial new ways for diabetes treatment.In the proposed project, we will evaluate alpha- and L-cell molecular alterations in diabetes due to insulin deficiency or insulin resistance and obesity. To this end we have generated diet-induced obesity (DIO) and streptozotocin-induced (STZ) diabetes models on a proglucagon-Venus transgenic mouse strain allowing the collection of pure fractions of pancreatic alpha-cells (islets of Langerhans) and intestinal L-cells (small intestine and colon) from control and diabetic mice using cell sorters.We previously analyzed the dysfunction of proglucagon-cells in these diabetic models through both functional and molecular analyses of alpha- and L-cells. We demonstrated:- Functional and molecular alterations/adaptations of alpha-and L-cells in both diabetic models;- Importance of cross-talks between alpha- and L-cells, in the maintenance of glucose homeostasis;- That GLP-1is a pivotal factor in the control of glycemia in obese mice through the regulation of glucagon secretion.We now aim to better characterize the diabetic molecular footprints of alpha- and L-cells in order to identify the molecular events leading to dysfunctional proglucagon-cells. We first propose to collect primary alpha- and L-cells from diabetic mice and to analyze microRNA and total mRNA expression. These descriptive analyses will be then completed by direct studies focusing on identified targets and their involvement in proglucagon-cell functions.All these studies will be performed in male mice, as females are protected from diabetes by estrogens through both islet and peripheral effects. This hormonal protection of females leads to a second axis of research to better understand the role of proglucagon-derived peptides in the adaptation/resistance to diabetes. We thus want to extend our studies on the importance of the L-cells/alpha-cells axis in the metabolic protection by estrogens using ovariectomized female mice with or without estradiol treatment to analyze functional and molecular consequences on alpha- and L-cells.We think that the proposed project should provide not only new insights into the control of glucose homeostasis through the adaptation or alteration of proglucagon-cell functions, but also pave the way to additional options of diabetes treatment.",Clinique Générale-Beaulieu,Genève,11685,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",Great Britain and Northern Ireland,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is underlain mechanistically by the transient or permanent induction of motility and invasiveness in the tumor cells. Blocking the dissemination process could prevent local tumor cell invasion, further dissemination from proximal metastases and the evolution towards a more aggressive phenotype. Yet most current treatments target growth and survival of the tumor cells and not the dissemination process. This lack of adequate anti-dissemination therapy is due in part to the complexity of the cell migration process itself and the redundancy of the signaling that control its mechanics. Additionally, cancer cells exploit mechanisms that normally direct physiological movements. However, the addiction of tumor cells to specific pathways and our increasing understanding of cell mechanics and its control offer room for therapeutic interventions targeting tumor cell dissemination.  Own research and methodology:We investigate tumor-specific dissemination mechanisms at the cellular and the molecular level in Medulloblastoma (MB), a metastatic brain tumor in children. We have identified pro-migratory and pro-invasive signaling pathways using a computer-assisted 2D/3D in vitro cell dissemination analysis platform. We now validate functional significance of the pathways identified and of effector molecules involved using ex vivo organotypic brain slice culture. This approach allows to systematically identify signaling pathways that promote or restrict MB cell dissemination and to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms in a physiologically relevant environment. As a key driver of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-induced MB cell dissemination we recently identified the Ser/Thr kinase MAP4K4. We found that MAP4K4 is involved in translating RTK signaling into morphodynamic processes relevant for cancer cell dissemination in 3D environments. While the work of others and our work have revealed the pro-metastatic potential of MAP4K4, the mechanistic details of its function during cell dissemination are poorly understood and subject of this proposal. MAP4Ks and in particular MAP4K4 control MB dissemination by modulating F-actin dynamics in invasive cell protrusions. We found that MAP4K4 is also required for vesicle trafficking in MB cells stimulated with HGF, which is a powerful driver of cancer cell dissemination. Hypothesis:Aberrant MAP4K4 function deviates growth factor signaling by linking locally enhanced F-actin-dynamics at the leading edge with vesicle trafficking and shifts growth factor and integrin receptor function towards pro-migratory activity.Objective:We will determine how MAP4K4-dependent F-actin dynamics controls vesicle trafficking and how the resulting altered endocytic activity could contribute to the pro-metastatic phenotype in MB. We will confirm the functional relevance of MAP4K4 and its effectors for tumor cell disseminating in the brain using organotypic brain slice culture and explore the selective blockade of small-scale dissemination as a potential anti-dissemination therapy approach for MB. Approach:We have identified putative MAP4K4 effectors by mass-spectrometry and will investigate those that are also known cytoskeleton or endocytosis regulators. Using our novel 3D cell dissemination and invasion analysis platform, we will identify the relevant effectors and determine how MAP4K4 controls their pro-migratory function in MB tumor cells. We will determine how MAP4K4 control of cytoskeleton regulators is coupled to integrin expression and function. We will determine how the interplay between actin polymerization and vesicle trafficking governed by MAP4K4 affects the motile and invasive behavior of the tumor cells. We will validate novel pro-migratory effectors identified in this process using organotypic brain slice tumor spheroid co-culture. Finally, we will experimentally test the recently proposed model of increased net tumor growth in dispersing solid tumors using organotypic brain slice culture.Significance:This study will reveal fundamental details of growth factor driven brain tumor cell dissemination and clarify the mechanistic details of MAP4K4 control of F-actin dynamics and vesicle trafficking under pathophysiological conditions. Finally, we will have experimentally tested whether small-scale dissemination in a dispersing solid tumor increased net tumor growth. If confirmed for MB, this finding will be milestone in MB research and markedly influence the future targeting strategies by shifting them towards anti-dissemination therapy.",Abteilung Onkologie Universitäts-Kinderspital Zürich,Zürich,75224,0000-0001-9539-7204,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication;Research Infrastructures;Exchange of personnel",Switzerland,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,165860,Other activities,Forschungstage Universitäts-Kinderspital Zürich,,2018

Here, we propose to examine functional diversity of vascular plant, butterfly and bird communities at a national scale, using data from the biodiversity monitoring program in Switzerland. Within this program, yearly landscape scale surveys have been undertaken since 2001, and the studied sites span an elevation gradient of more than 2'500 meters. The data provide unique opportunities to study patterns of functional diversity in different trophic levels and along a large elevation gradient. We will use contemporary approaches such as structural equation models to infer how the trophic links between plant, butterfly and bird communities change across space and times, and estimate a series of metrics for examining the functional structure of species communities in Swiss landscapes.From a conservation point of view, landscape-scale studies are central because ecosystems are usually managed, and ecosystem services are delivered, at the landscape scale. Since manipulative experiments are hardly feasible at the landscape scale, inferring patterns from observational studies are necessary to understand relevant trait similarity patterns across landscapes. However, one of the greatest challenges when analysing ecological data of this type is the imperfect detection of species. We will thus study how biases resulting from imperfect detection could be accounted for in research on functional diversity. We will employ site-occupancy analyses using Bayesian posterior sampling to develop methods for estimating functional diversity by accounting for imperfect detection. We will use these methods to draw robust inference on patterns of functional diversity in subsequent analyses.Combining a multitrophic perspective with an approach based on functional diversity has been suggested as the necessary next step to advance research on community ecology. This is further underpinned by the notion that many ecosystem services ultimately rely on interactions between plants and organisms belonging to other trophic levels. We propose analyses on elevational patterns and temporal trends in functional diversity that will be compared among plant, butterfly and bird communities. We will adopt conceptual frameworks from classic food web research and test predictions using measures of functional diversity. For example, we will test whether the links between trophic levels, quantified based on correlations in their functional diversity, change along a productivity gradient as predicted by a number of theoretical models. Furthermore, we will test whether functional redundancy, which could act to insure the maintenance of ecosystem functioning in the face of species loss caused by global change, varies with the environment and how the degree of redundancy varies between trophic levels. For example, it is currently unknown whether, within the same environments, communities from different trophic levels have similar (i.e., correlated) degrees of functional redundancy.Overall, our proposed studies will provide a comparative synthesis of the patterns of functional diversity of three trophic levels across Swiss landscapes. The expected results will add to the understanding of the driving forces that structure ecological communities. Since we infer patterns of functional trait diversity, which is currently one of the most promising surrogate measures of community assembly and ecosystem services, the expected results will provide the possibility of mapping the delivery of ecosystem services at the national scale, which complies with the strategic goals of the Swiss biodiversity strategy to quantify ecosystem services across entire Switzerland.",Evolutionsbiologie Zoologisches Institut Universität Basel,Basel,515110,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",Switzerland,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),Using change-point models to estimate empirical critical loads for nitrogen in mountain ecosystems,"Roth Tobias,  Kohli Lukas,  Rihm Beat,  Meier Reto,  Achermann Beat",Published,2017,,10.1016/j.envpol.2016.10.083,,Environmental Pollution,,Environmental Pollution,220,,1480,1487,Environmental Pollution,,To protect ecosystems and their services the critical load concept has been implemented under the framework of the Convention on Long range Transboundary Air Pollution (UNECE) to develop effectsoriented air pollution abatement strategies.

We tested the method using simulated data with varying sample sizes varying effects of confounding variables and with varying negative effects of N deposition on species richness. The method was applied to the national scale plant species richness data from mountain hay meadows and (sub)alpine scrubs sites in Switzerland. Seven confounding factors (elevation inclination precipitation calcareous content aspect as well as indicator values for humidity and light) were selected based on earlier studies examining numerous environmental factors to explain Swiss vascular plant diversity. The estimated critical load confirmed the existing empirical critical load of 5e15 kg N ha 1 yr 1 for (sub)alpine scrubs while for mountain hay meadows the estimated critical load was at the lower end of the current empirical critical load range.

If detected early, while still confined to the uterus the prognosis can be good, however if recurrence occurs the survival time will barely exceed 12 months [2]. Current treatment decisions are based on the histopathology and tumour stage as defined by the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) with recommended treatment including peritoneal lavage for cytology and total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and dissection of the pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes, although in cases with a low risk early stage diagnosis (FIGO Stage IA, G1, G2) lymphadenectomy is still controversial [3-5].Lymphadenectomy can be accompanied by serious long-term morbidity and intra-operative surgical complications and recently multi-centre studies reported that complete lymphadenectomy is not associated with any improvement in oncological outcomes in women with early stage endometrial carcinoma [3, 6, 7]. Physicians therefore are left with the choice of either the under treatment of women with early stage endometrial carcinoma who have a predisposition to recurrence, or the over treatment of women who will not recur. To address this treatment gap a sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has been suggested [8]. SLN biopsies represent a less invasive method of examining patients for metastasis and early reports indicate when combined with pathological ultrastaging it can result in the upstaging of approximately 10% of patients [9]. In addition recent advances with the tracer indocyanine green (ICG) have made significant improvements in the accuracy and efficacy of the SLN mapping [10].The effectiveness of SLN mapping is dependent on the detection of metastatic tissue in the lymph node biopsies and is usually performed via histopathological ultrastaging.  While ultrastaging is currently the most accurate method for the detection of metastatic tissue, it does however come with some inherent drawbacks. The examination of multi-tissue sections by a Pathologist is time consuming and ultimately relies on individual judgments. Molecular biological techniques avoid these problems and are gaining acceptance as they can be as equally effective in detecting micrometastases and can be automated. A molecular biological technique that has not yet been explored for the detection of metastatic material is micro RNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs are deregulated in cancer tissue, more stable than RNA and can be easily retrieved from various storage material including formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples [11]. Lastly, while an accurate detection of metastatic tissue is vital for the successful use of the SLN mapping technique, ultimately there would be more significant benefits to the treatment of women if those at high risk of recurrence could be identified prior to metastasis taking place. Genetic mutations are related to endometrial cancer development and may be related to recurrence in early stage type I endometrial cancer [12].We propose therefore to address the gap in the treatment of early stage endometrial cancer by developing a SLN biopsy technique that combined with ultrastaging can successfully identify women whose primary tumour has metastasised. In addition we propose to further enhance the accuracy and utility of this surgical technique by developing a method of metastasis detection based on miRNA expression. Lastly, in an attempt to address the issue of recurrence directly and before metastasis has occurred we will examine the primary tumour of early stage endometrial cancer patients for genetic mutations related to recurrence.

The importance of a functional collateral circulation in the situation of chronic stable CAD is widely agreed upon. In acute atherosclerotic coronary occlusion, infarct size expansion can only be limited by sufficiently functional and preformed collaterals. Conceptually, therapeutic collateral promotion can occur by direct application  of pro-arteriogenic substances or by physical augmentation of vascular endothelial tangential shear forces. So far, the human coronary collateral circulation appears to be better promotable by “biophysical” arteriogenesis. However, sustainability of any arteriogenic procedure has not been investigated so far. Recently, the prevalent and functional existence of natural internal mammary artery (IMA) bypasses to the ipsilateral coronary artery has been documented during simultaneous temporary distal IMA and proximal coronary artery occlusion; primary endpoint in that study was collateral flow index (CFI, the ratio between coronary occlusive and aortic pressure both subtracted by central venous pressure). Consequently, a coronary steal phenomenon would have to take place in the presence of a flow-diverting vascular resistance decrease during hyperemia in a coronary-“adjacent” circulatory region, the arm. This theoretical corollary has not been tested yet, and its proof would strongly support the prospect of permanent ipsilateral distal IMA occlusion as effective coronary revascularization method. Accordingly, it is the goal of the upcoming 3-year period of the project on the human coronary collateral circulation supported by the SNF for the past 18 years to perform the following investigations in 250 patients without and with chronic stable CAD:Pathophysiologic aspects of coronary collaterals: -Coronary steal via ipsilateral internal mammary arteries (n=100)Hypothesis: Coronary collateral flow index (CFI) decreases during ipsilateral temporary IMA occlusion when ipsilateral arm hyperemia is induced in the course of the same coronary occlusion.Design: Observational study with intra-individual comparison of CFI during ipsilateral IMA occlusion upon release 4.5 minutes after an ipsilateral arm blood pressure cuff inflation.Therapeutic promotion of coronary collaterals: -Effect of permanent right (R)IMA occlusion on right coronary artery collateral function (CFI): Proof of concept (n=50)Hypothesis: Right coronary artery CFI is increased 6 weeks after permanent distal RIMA occlusion.Design: Clinical interventional open, feasibility and proof-of-concept study with intra-individual comparison of CFI at baseline and 6 weeks after permanent RIMA occlusion.-Effect of permanent right (R)IMA occlusion on right coronary artery collateral function (CFI): Randomized controlled trial (n=100)Hypothesis: The change from baseline to follow-up examination in CFI of the RCA is higher in the group of patients with than without permanent RIMA occlusion.Design: Clinical interventional open trial with 1:1 randomized patient allocation to permanent RIMA occlusion at baseline or to no RIMA occlusion (control group).","Klinik und Poliklinik für Kardiologie Departement Herz und Gefässe Universitätsklinik, Inselspital",Bern,61317,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),Physical exercise and quantitative lower limb collateral function,"Stoller Michael,  Stoller David,  Seiler Christian",Published,2016,,10.1136/openhrt-2015-000355,,Open Heart,,Open Heart,3,1,e000355,e000355,Open Heart,,Objective: This study tested the hypothesis that  global physical activity and physical performance  parameters are directly related to invasively obtained  left superficial femoral artery (SFA) collateral flow index  (CFI).

Therefore, an endogenous regulatory process exists (known as functional hyperemia or neurovascular coupling), linking elevated neuronal energy demand with increased local blood flow (1). Much of the work to date has focused on blood flow changes within arterioles and arteries, but recent evidence suggests local blood flow can be regulated at the capillary level by a specific mural cell population: pericytes (2, 3). Pericytes are able to constrict brain capillaries, but there is conflicting evidence about their contribution in neurovascular coupling.Currently, only two studies have examined pericyte-mediated functional hyperemia in vivo, and they reported contradictory results: one study did not observe capillary events (4), while the other revealed fast capillary dilations that occurred before arteriole responses (2). These opposing outcomes could be attributed to differences in experimental design, data analysis, stimulation protocols, anesthesia, and vascular classification. Furthermore, neither of these studies considered intracellular signaling mechanisms regulating pericyte tone (2, 4).Our group has extensive experience with cellular imaging and blood flow measurements in vivo, and we plan to use a multi-modal approach to gain novel insights into unknown pericyte structure, intracellular signaling mechanisms and their contribution to hemodynamic responses. More specifically, we plan to work on the following three aims: Aim 1: Characterize intracellular signaling regulating brain pericyte tone in vitro and in vivo. We will investigate calcium signaling, membrane potential changes, and the activity of ATP-sensitive potassium channels in both cultured cortical pericytes and cortical pericytes in vivo. To date, visualization of intracellular signals within cortical pericytes has proven to be problematic due to the non-specificity of chemical indicators (5), so we will apply new genetic indicator tools (e.g. Ca2+, membrane potential and ATP/ADP sensors) which will selectively target pericyte cellular signaling. In addition, we will investigate the relevance of selected pathways in regulating pericyte tone in vivo by targeted gene knockout specifically in pericytes. Aim 2: Investigate the contribution of pericytes to functional hyperemia and hemodynamics in vivo. To study this, we will examine neurovascular coupling in adult pericyte-deficient animals in vivo, and also selectively alter pericyte tone by optogenetic stimulation to explore pericyte-induced changes in local blood flow. This will involve a precise analysis of hemodynamics, including capillary diameter and erythrocyte velocity and density measurements with two-photon microscopy. We plan to focus on imaging awake animals to limit the effects of anesthesia and specifically examine blood flow at capillary branch points that are surrounded by pericytes. Aim 3: High resolution imaging of neurovascular unit with special focus on pericyte contacts with endothelium and astrocytes. We will conduct high-resolution imaging of pericytes in situ to precisely elucidate their structure and connections to neighbouring cells. Using correlative light electron microscopy, we will collect functional information (i.e. changes in pericyte tone and hemodynamics) by two-photon microscopy before detailed structural analysis of the same tissue and cells by electron microscopy.A detailed functional and structural analysis of pericyte-mediated tone in vivo is currently lacking. This work has the potential to clarify the three-dimensional structure, the cellular mechanisms and the impact of pericyte tone in functional hyperemia. Our proposed research is also relevant to multiple diseases since pericytes have been shown to contract during ischemia (2, 6), and functional hyperemia is reportedly abnormal in other neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia.1.Roy CS & Sherrington CS (1890) On the Regulation of the Blood-supply of the Brain.

Plant vasculature comprises two distinct transport systems, xylem and phloem. Xylem consists of connected vessels, which transport water and nutrients extracted from the soil to the rest of the plant body. Phloem is a more complex and versatile tissue, which distributes photosynthetic sugars, nutrients as well as developmental signals throughout the plant, typically from source to sink organs. Phloem sap conduits are formed by connected sieve elements, whose differentiation includes cell elongation, wall thickening and enucleation. Surprisingly little is known about the molecular-genetic control of this vital differentiation process. Our observations suggest that it is self-organizing and involves a spatio-temporal shift in the response to autocrine peptide signals.The growth apices of plants, the meristems, connect to established vasculature via continuous production of early phloem, so-called protophloem. An ideal system to investigate this process is the Arabidopsis root meristem, where protophloem strand formation can be followed along the spatio-temporal gradient of single cell files. In the last years, we have defined a molecular-genetic network that consists of two antagonistic modules and guides the formation of root protophloem sieve elements, starting from their stem cells. The positive regulators comprise the BREVIS RADIX (BRX) and OCTOPUS (OPS) genes. BRX encodes a protein that is mostly plasma membrane-associated in protophloem cells, with polar, rootward localization. Recent data suggest that BRX serves as a phosphorylation decoy for D6 PROTEIN KINASE (D6PK). Because phosphorylation by D6PK activates PIN-FORMED auxin carriers, BRX thereby dampens cellular auxin efflux, in line with the notion that fine-tuned cellular auxin activity is crucial for protophloem differentiation. The OPS protein is also plasma membrane-associated in protophloem cells, and also polar localized, however shootward. OPS is a quantitative master regulator of cellular commitment to sieve element differentiation, whose activity is adjusted by a phosphorylation site that is likely regulated by phosphatase 2A. The negative regulators of protophloem differentiation comprise components of an autocrine signaling pathway, the secreted peptide ligand CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION 45 (CLE45), its cognate receptor BARELY ANY MERISTEM 3 (BAM3), the partially redundant co-receptors SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE 1 (SERK1) and SERK2, the signal transducer MEMBRANE-ASSOCIATED KINASE REGULATOR 5 (MAKR5); and a nuclear effector, the histone demethylase JUMONJI 14. Our research will characterize these molecular switches and their interactions in crisp detail. To identify missing negative regulators, we will saturate an on-going brx second site suppressor screen and initiate a similar screen for ops. To identify missing positive regulators, we will perform an innovative third site suppressor screen, based on an artificial “super-active” OPS gain-of-function allele that fully complements the severe protophloem phenotype of brx ops loss-of-function double mutants. Finally, we will complete a simple forward genetic screen to identify components of the CLE26 signaling pathway, which redundantly masks morphological phenotypes of CLE45 pathway mutants. In parallel, we will intensively explore mechanistic aspects of BRX, OPS and CLE45-BAM3 action, such as BRX regulation of polar auxin transport, post-translational determinants of shootward OPS polarity, or MAKR5 signal transduction. To tackle this task biochemically, we will exploit a novel assay that triggers massive trans-differentiation of mesophyll cells into sieve elements. Finally, we will quantify cellular and sub-cellular abundance of pathway components at high resolution along developing protophloem strands for computational analysis of their interdependence. Because all positive and negative regulators identified so far are expressed from the beginning to the end of the differentiation process, this could reveal how developing protophloem cells eventually escape their autocrine peptide signals to switch from proliferation to differentiation in a self-organizing spatio-temporal manner.",Dépt de Biologie Moléculaire Végétale Faculté de Biologie et de Médecine Université de Lausanne,Lausanne,515074,0000-0003-3203-1058,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Promoting an efficient vascularization of tissue-engineered (TE) osteogenic constructs upon in vivo implantation remains a major challenge towards their clinical application for bone regeneration and repair. Though numerous studies based on pre-vascularization of TE grafts by using vascular cells demonstrated the validity of this approach, they so far failed to define precise parameters, such as the cellular composition (density of endothelial and pericytic cells and of macrophages) and the degree of maturation/ramification of the preformed vascular structures necessary to make such pre-vascular structures fully supportive of vascularization, engraftment and survival of cell inside the implant upon in vivo implantation. This is likely to ultimately regulate tissue formation in vivo.Working hypothesis.The degree of pre-vascularization and the density of macrophages in vitro regulate the vascularization, the engraftment and the bone formation capacity of TE osteogenic grafts in vivo.Specific aims.To address this question, 3 aims are defined: 1) Aim 1 will define if, and how, different in vitro maturation/ramification levels of vascular structures in vitro could affect the density (number of capillaries, branches and total capillary length) of the vascularization in those grafts upon in vivo implantation. 2) Aim 2 will investigate to which extent such different densities of vascularization reached in vivo could in turn affect the engraftment, as judged by cell survival in the graft and performance of the osteogenic grafts in terms of density and volume of bone formation. 3) Finally, aim 3 will examine how macrophages of different phenotypes, included in the grafts or recruited from the host, affect vascularization and bone formation, and how to better harness the power of macrophages to produce enhanced TE bone.Experimental design.The study will use a previously established cell culture and in vivo system using progenitor cells freshly isolated from human adipose tissue, typically referred to as stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells, demonstrated not to only generate osteogenic grafts but also an intrinsic vasculogenic capacity in vivo. Pre-vascularization density in vitro will be modulated by varying the in vitro culture duration and the effect of this pre-vascularization density on the vascular density, survival of cells inside the implanted grafts and volume of bone formation in vivo. In the same model, the contribution of macrophages of different phenotypes to those processes will be evaluated by depletion of specific populations by using cell sorting or enrichment with peripheral-blood derived macrophages.Expected value of the proposed project. We propose a systematic approach to aim at defining release criteria and quality markers for the use of SVF cells-based grafts as clinical tools, such as i) percentage of specific vascular cells, ii) degrees of vascular cells organization/vascular structure density and iii) percentage and phenotype of macrophages.

Substantial research effort has gone into unraveling the basic molecular mechanisms involved. In particular the role of the actin- and microtubule cytoskeletons and of the proteins organizing these filamentous structures has drawn much attention. Surprisingly, not much is known about the contribution of membranes despite the fact that a plethora of lipid variants exist that could in principle combine to form a huge number of specialized membrane domains with specific function. Exceptions that are being intensively studied are the so-called “lipid rafts”, sterol-rich, detergent resistant membranes that play a central role in polarity maintenance of polarized cells. In addition various phospholipids were shown to be important for cell-cell signaling and for cellular stress response. We have previously started investigating the role of sterol-rich membranes (SRMs) during cell polarization in fission yeast. We made use of a new live marker and of an experimental system in which we could investigate the role of these specialized membranes during de novo cell polarization. We found that SRMs are absolutely fundamental to the process, serving as platforms on which the relevant protein machinery assembles prior to its activation. While the platforms initially distribute all over the cell, the crucial polarizing role of the microtubule cytoskeleton then is to stabilize and mark the polar platforms for later growth activation, while the actin cytoskeleton is required to eliminate those that are wrongly positioned in the cell center (actin). Surprisingly, we find good evidence that polarization does not involve Cdc42 activity, which is generally thought to be the central player in cell polarization. Instead we find evidence for non-vesicular sterol trafficking in playing a role. The follow up grant now will focus on identifying the molecular machinery linking the MT (and actin) cytoskeleton to SRM formation and to non-vesicular trafficking. For this we would like to follow three lines of investigation: A) a candidate approach with the suspected proteins of the non-vesicular trafficking pathway in continuation of a project initiated with the first granting period, B) an unbiased approach in which we will screen the fission yeast library of viable gene deletions for factors affecting SRM formation and polarization and C) the continuation of our biochemical project of the first granting period in which we have isolated SRMs and their proteins with the detergent resistant membrane fraction from various wild type and mutant cell strains for a comparative analysis. The resulting candidates now need further characterization.In a newly added project we are investigating a novel phenomenon that results in the total immobilization of visible particles in the cytoplasm, which we termed cytoplasmic freezing. Starved cells, which are the starting point of our cell polarization experiments, can rapidly switch into this state and re-mobilization after nutrient supply takes less than a few minutes. This state is not the consequence of fluid loss that would increase molecular crowding and it occurs independent of known cytoskeletal elements. This is the first evidence that eukaryotic cells possess a molecular mechanism that controls the viscosity of the cytoplasm. Our goal is to identify the molecules involved, to find a role for this state and to find evidence for conservation of active cytoplasmic viscosity control in higher eukaryotes.",Institute of Molecular Life Sciences Universität Zürich,Zürich,501060,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication;Research Infrastructures",Switzerland,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),Sterol-Rich Membrane Domains Define Fission Yeast Cell Polarity,"Makushok Tatyana,  Alves Paulo,  Huisman Stephen Michiel,  Kijowski Adam Rafal,  Brunner Damian",Published,2016,,10.1016/j.cell.2016.04.037,,Cell,,Cell,165,5,1182,1196,Cell,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

SUMMARY OF THE RESEARCH PLAN (max. 1 page)Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are a group of diseases characterized by aberrant proliferation of the erythroid, megakaryocytic and myeloid lineages. They represent clonal disorders of the hematopoietic stem cell with an inherent tendency towards leukemic transformation. MPN are subdivided into three disease entities: polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Somatic gain of function mutations in the genes JAK2, CALR, or MPL can be detected in blood cells of close to 90% of MPN patients. These gene mutations are known to act as drivers that can cause MPN phenotypes in patients and mouse models. MPN is a clonal disease of the hematopoietic stem cells. Disease manifestation and prognosis is in part influenced by additional somatic mutation that synergize with the driver mutations, but alone do not cause disease. These additional mutations most frequently occur in genes encoding epigenetic regulators, such as TET2, DNMT3a or EZH2. JAK2-V617F is the most frequent driver gene mutation occurring in 70-80% of MPN patients. Why some patients with JAK2-V617F, develop ET while others manifest as PV remains an open question. In contrast, JAK2 exon 12 mutations are tightly associated with PV and in many cases present as pure erythrocytosis. Both types of JAK2 mutations signal through the same C-terminal tyrosine kinase of JAK2, but result in very different phenotypic readouts. Furthermore, various knockin and transgenic mouse models of JAK2-V617F substantially differ in phenotypes, despite existing on the same genetically defined inbred background. We derived hypotheses and found factors that are likely to influence the phenotypic expression of MPN, which we will study in this proposal. We also derived preliminary data suggesting that the MPN hematopoietic stem cells are profoundly altered in their metabolism. Finally, we identified potential target genes that mediate the synergistic effects of JAK2-V617F and the loss of the epigenetic regulator EZH2. The proposed experiments will address the following specific aims:1. To examine genotype-phenotype correlations in MPN and define factors that determine ET versus PV phenotypes in MPN with mutated JAK2.2. To characterize altered characteristics of MPN stem cells, in particular the changes in transcriptome, metabolism, autophagy and lysosomal integrity.3. To study synergism between JAK2-V617F and mutations in epigenetic regulators in MPN pathogenesis and functionally test and validate candidate targets that mediate loss of Ezh2 in MPN.Significance: Our studies address important unsolved questions in the pathogenesis of MPN. We aim to test new hypotheses that may explain why one mutation (JAK2-V617F) can manifest as different clinical entities (ET or PV) with large inter-individual variation in the involvement of peripheral blood lineages. We also focus on poorly studied aspects of MPN stem cell biology, in particular metabolism, that could have major impact on the biology of MPN and may represent target for specific intervention. Our studies of synergism between JAK2-V617F and mutations in epigenetic regulator genes are likely to yield new insight into MPN progression to myelofibrosis and acute leukemia.",Departement Biomedizin Universität Basel,Basel,27782,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication;Research Infrastructures",Switzerland,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The recent success of checkpoint inhibition immunotherapy in cancer, by blockade of inhibitory receptors to enhance T cell responses, illustrates the potential of exploiting natural immunoregulatory mechanisms as a therapeutic strategy. Siglec-7 and -9 are inhibitory receptors that, unlike currently targeted molecules on CD8+ T cells (CTLA-4, PD-1, Tim-3, and LAG-3), recognize glycan ligands. In preliminary results, we found that Siglec-7 and -9 regulate responses of human primary CD8+ T cells and evidence supporting a role of Siglecs in lymphocyte immune synapse formation and function. Interestingly, we found that subsets of Siglec-7 and -9 positive CD8+ T cells are dramatically increased in patients with autoimmune disease or cancer, both systemically and locally, reflecting reactive expansion under pathological conditions. Human tissue Neu5Ac-glycans are thought to dampen immunity as “self-associated molecular patterns” by interaction with Siglecs, and we previously reported that overexpression of Siglec-7 and -9 ligands by altered surface glycosylation protects tumor cells from innate immune responses. In the present study, we intend to further explore the role of Siglec-7 and -9 in human primary CD8+ T cells, the characteristics of Siglec-7+ and -9+ CD8+ T cells in disease, and to investigate systemic levels of autoantibodies to Siglecs or to their human Neu5Ac-sialoglycan ligands in autoimmune disease or cancer. Furthermore, potential therapeutics targeting Siglec-7+ and -9+ shall be tested, including glycan polymers, intravenous immunoglobulin subfractions, or nanoparticles carrying synthetic sialoglycan ligands, as pharmacological agonist/antagonist or as drug vehicle.Specific Aim 1: To explore Siglec-7 and -9 receptor functions in human primary CD8+ T cellsSpecific Aim 2: To characterize human Siglec+ CD8+ T cells in health and diseaseSpecific Aim 3: To investigate if Siglecs are mechanistically involved in cytolytic immunological synapse (IS) formationSpecific Aim 4: To explore the occurrence of autoantibodies to Siglecs or human Siglec Neu5Ac-glycan ligands to Siglec-7 or -9 in autoimmune disease or immunodeficiencySpecific Aim 5: To test effects of potential therapeutics targeting Siglec-7/-9 receptors or their ligands in vitro",Institut für Pharmakologie Medizinische Fakultät Universität Bern,Bern,504847,0000-0002-2753-8738,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results",Switzerland,Peer-reviewed,,Antibody repertoire profiling with mimotope arrays,"Pashova S.,  Schneider C.,  von Gunten S.,  Pashov A.",Published,2017,,10.1080/21645515.2017.1264786,,Human Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics,,Human Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics,13,2,314,322,Human Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here we propose to define reliable markers for identifying TRM cells; to determine how the generation, and differentiation of (intestinal) TRM cells is regulated, and to explore strategies to potentially extend the remission period using a recently established novel mouse model of remitting - relapsing colitis.Working hypothesis The generation and persistence of TRM is critically regulated by Regulator of G-protein Signaling (Rgs) - genes, which can be used as a positive identifier of TRM cells. The functional and phenotypic differentiation of locally generated CD4 TRM cells is influenced by the intestinal microenvironment. During chronic intestinal inflammation, CD4 TRM cells progressively differentiate into distinct CD4 T cell subsets, including highly pro-inflammatory  CD4 TRM subsets, which cause relapsing disease. Specific interventions to block this progressive differentiation will extend the remission phase. Specific AimsBased on our current data in mouse models of colitis we propose: •To identify functional markers that allow the identification of tissue resident memory T cells (TRM) in the intestinal mucosa (but likely also in other barrier tissues).•To use our recently established mouse model of a remitting - relapsing colitis in mice to follow the functional and phenotypic characteristics of CD4 TRM in the intestinal mucosa in homeostatic and inflammatory conditions.•To determine the distinct requirements for the generation, persistence and functional differentiation of intestinal CD4 TRM cells.•To assess specific interventions aimed at  either the intestinal microbiota, the local immune homeostasis and the intestinal stromal cells for their impact on the differentiation and activation of the local CD4 TRM cells in order to extend the remission phase (or even: prevent further relapses).Experimental design TRM cells at barrier tissues consist of a wide array of T cells includinge both “unconventional” (or “innate”) T cells, and and conventional MHC class I and II restricted CD8?? and CD4 TCR?? T cells. , which may differ in the spectrum of antigenic epitopes recognized, their restriction elements, and their effector functions.  We propose to initially look (as “pars pro toto”) aton two resident T cell subsets that so far received limited attention; i.e. the unconventional CD8?? TCR?? T cells, which in mice are preferentially found in the small intestinal epithelium and the intestinal CD4 TRM cells. As a model of remitting - relapsing colitis  the CD4 CD45RBhi T cell induced  mouse model of colitis in lymphopenic recipients will be used, where active colitis is rapidly reversed by the administration of a depleting anti-CD4 mAb. Anti-CD4 treated mice, however, tend to reproducibly relapse within 20-22 days after the treatment. Using RNASeq analysis together with the appropriate bioinformatic support for analysis we expect to define core transcriptome profiles of intestinal CD8?? TCR?? and CD4 TRM cells during homeostatic, inflammatory, remitting, and relapsing conditions. These transcriptomes will be  compared with those of intestinal also from TCR?? T cells and and CD8?? TCR?? T cells during homeostasis. Results obtained are expected to allow the identification of signaling pathways that regulate the generation and further differentiation of TRM cells in homeostasis and inflammation. These candidates, together with candidates we identified in our ongoing work, will the be tested using co-transfer of CD45 congenic CD4 T cell subsets from genetically modified donor mice, vs. WT CD4 T cell subsets to directly determine the impact of a gene of interest on the generation, localization,  and persistence, and functional differentiation of TRM cells in the intestinal mucosa. With this insight, we will finally attempt to interfere with those TRM cells that give rise to “pathogenic” effector T cells (and TRM cells) in chronic intestinal inflammation and cause relapsing colitis. Approaches to be initially tested for their impact on remitting vs. relapsing colitis include:•Interfering with the normal microbiota of the host•Interfering with distinct signaling pathways used by the pathogenic CD4 TRM cells,•Attempts to modulate pharmacologically the intestinal stromal cell compartment using agonists (vs. antagonists) of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway to generate a local environment that favors the generation of homeostasis-supporting CD4 TRM  cells and thus, extends the remission interval.Expected value of the project •Define a core transcriptome to positively identify (and distinguish) (intestinal) TRM cells and distinguish them from circulating cells), as a rationale for the subsequent generation of a reporter mouse to follow TRM cells in vivo •Define the requirements and signaling pathways involved) in the generation of (TRM cells (notably, CD4 TRM cells)•Define the (progressive ) differentiation of CD4 TRM cells in the intestinal mucosa during homeostasis, colitis, remission and relapse•Determine the factors that regulate the functional characteristics of CD4 TRM cells as key players in mediating the decision-making between inflammation vs. remission vs. relapsing inflammatory diseases.With the present work we expect to gain insight into the fundamental mechanisms that regulate the generation, persistence and functional activity of TRM cells in barrier tissues, which critically determine the outcome of inflammatory disease. We also aim to identify novel pathways that may directly affect the generation and differentiation of pro-inflammatory CD4 TRM cells, and hence, represent potential targets for treating patients with relapsing intestinal inflammatory disorders.

Parasite proteins with invasive functions, released from rhoptries, micronemes and dense granules, are highly interesting vaccine targets, but information on parasite antigens specifically targeted by T cells is sparse. The development of subunit vaccines against neosporosis has been hampered by the fact that an immune response that is induced in a non-pregnant animal prior to pregnancy is generally not maintained, or when maintained, not appropriately, for pregnancy. Thus, alternative approaches for defining vaccine candidates are needed. Experience from other disease models shows that T cell antigens could constitute prime vaccine candidates. In addition, chemotherapy could offer an alternative and/or addition to vaccination. In this respect, inhibitors of calcium-dependent protein kinase 1, such as the bumped kinase inhibitor BKI-1294, exhibit outstanding efficacy in the non-pregnant and pregnant neosporosis mouse models, and BKI-1294 has emerged as a prime candidate to be further evaluated in a ruminant model. BKI-1294 does not kill the parasites instantly but interferes in the separation of daughter zoites. This leads to the formation of large intracellular multinucleated complexes, which remain viable for several days to weeks in vitro. Preliminary studies indicate that this could also impact on the immune response against the parasite in vivo, and this cross-talk between chemotherapy and immunity aspect will be further elaborated in this project. Working hypotheses: (1.) BKI-1294 treatment in mice enhances the immune response against infection, which in turn supports treatment efficacy.(2.) Antigens targeted by N. caninum-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells represent potential vaccine candidates. (3.) BKI-1294 limits neosporosis and also impacts on the immune response in sheep. Specific aims:(1.) Characterization of (i) the proteome of multinucleated complexes in N. caninum-infected host cells treated with BKI-1294 in vitro, and of (ii) the immune response in BKI-1294-treated and non-treated infected T cell deficient and wildtype mice. (2.) Identification and characterization of Neospora T-cell target antigens, assessment of their vaccine potential in pregnant mice, and preliminary evaluation of their antigenicity in N. caninum infected pregnant sheep.(3.) Assessment of BKI-1294 therapy in the pregnant neosporosis sheep model, and its impact on the ovine immune response.Experimental design and/or methods: (1.) BKI-1294-induced proteome changes will be analyzed in a time-course experiment by immunoblotting followed by LC-MS. Overexpressed proteins that are potentially targeted by the immune response will be identified by immunoblotting and recombinantly expressed. Innate and acquired immune responses in BKI-treated or non-treated Neospora-infected pregnant or non-pregnant mice are comparatively analyzed, and the effects of BKI-treatment on immunity assessed by re-challenge experiments. Experiments in athymic nude mice will be performed to study the role of T cells in compound efficacy.(2.) Generation of N. caninum-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell lines (NcTcs) from pregnant and non-pregnant mice with acute or chronic infection, which will be studied with regard to proliferation, phenotype (CD4+ and CD8+ populations), polarization and cytotoxicity. We will identify proteins targeted by T cells through screening antigens previously studied in the group as vaccine candidates, antigens shown to be upregulated in virulent isolates, and antigens upregulated in multinucleated complexes. The targeted antigens are then assessed for their immunoprotective potential in the pregnant neosporosis mouse model.(3.) BKI-1294 efficacy will be studied in the N. caninum-infected pregnant sheep model. Parameters in dams (clinical signs such as fever and abortion) and offspring (fetal death, stillbirth, birth of weak offspring, neurological disorders, congenital transmission in healthy lambs) will be assessed. Tissue samples of aborted offspring and/or newborn lambs will be analyzed by (immuno)histology and real time PCR for measuring parasite and lesion presence and infection intensity. Cellular and humoral peripheral responses and comparative detection of cytokines in placental tissues will be analyzed by real time PCR, ELISA and IHC to study the role of immunity during BKI-1294 treatment in sheep. Expected value of the project: This project aims to develop novel tools to prospectively limit economic losses due to neosporosis, but has a wider impact in that CDPK1 is an important drug target in other apicomplexan parasites such as Toxoplasma, Cryptosporidium, and Besnoitia among others. For the development of preventive or therapeutical measures against neosporosis, it is important to show whether and how BKI-1294 affects the immunogenicity of the parasite, and whether this change could be a relevant factor for improving protective immunity and contribute to compound efficacy. As the role of T cell immunity in neosporosis has not been widely explored, we aim to identify novel T-cell targets, and these can constitute novel vaccine candidates. This project aims to shed light on the relationship between immunity and BKI-1294 therapy, and provides important information on how vaccination could be coupled to a drug treatment strategy, both in mice but also in a ruminant model that largely mimics infection in cattle. Prospectively, a combined immune-chemotherapeutical approach could represent an interesting option for future development of effective measures against neosporosis, and possibly also related apicomplexans such as Toxoplasma, Besnoitia among others.",Institut für Parasitologie Universität Bern,Bern,19483,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Research Infrastructures",Switzerland,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

ALL is a complex genetic disease with initiating lesions that often target hematopoietic transcription factors, resulting in reprogramming of pathways that regulate hematopoietic development. The leukemia initiating and propagating cells are strictly dependent on interactions with the microenvironment for survival. Several studies indicate that ALL cells may compete with normal hematopoietic stem and precursor cells for interaction sites in the hematopoietic niche. Furthermore, protective effects of niche components could influence disease progression and drug resistance. Different stromal cell types may be implicated, including endosteal osteoblasts and multipotent perivascular stromal cells, but the topology and function of the leukemia niche remain to be characterized. We have established a powerful and comprehensive ALL xenograft model that closely mimics the original human disease to explore new possibilities for the treatment of resistant disease. We hypothesize that essential leukemia niche functions must be conserved between mice and man to support ALL progagation in xenografts. Here we propose to investigate the site and type of interactions between leukemia cells and bone marrow stroma by focusing on a unique collection of 10 xenografts of a highly chemotherapy resistant subtype of ALL. This subtype is defined by the chromosomal translocation t(17;19) resulting in an aberrant transcription factor E2A-HLF and represents a group of patients with unmet clinical needs. The fusion deregulates a genetic program via HLF, which is highly expressed in normal hematopoietic stem cells. For comparison we established xenografts of t(1;19) translocated ALL (fusion transcription factor E2A-PBX1), a subtype with good outcome and a gene expression profile enriched for more differentiated lineage features. With next generation sequencing we could show that the clonal composition of xenografts from both subtypes are very stable compared to diagnostic patient material. With this model we will address the following aims: Aim 1. Topology of the leukemia niche in the bone marrow under selective pressureWe will visualize predilection sites for ALL in the bone marrow of xenografts in the setting of minimal disease and under selective pressure with chemotherapy.Aim 2. Leukemia-induced modification of the bone marrow to create a supportive niche We will characterize the modulation of cellular signals in vitro and in vivo upon contact of ALL with stroma and investigate the potential for therapeutic intervention.Aim 3. Identification of synergistic combinations of novel therapeutic agents for eradication of E2A-HLF positive leukemia propagating cellsWe will test combinations of new agents based on extensive single agent activity data to identify active combinations along with potential biomarkers in order to propose concrete alternatives for experimental therapy for this group of patients at unmet need.

Research in photobiology on the impact of light on human physiological and behavioral functions is in its early stages, but is progressing rapidly. It has informed us about how light of different wavelength and intensity affects our capacities to respond to light dependent on time-of-day, and how exposure to dynamic lighting conditions influences such capacities. These findings offer the means to advance and validate novel methods to assess and influence how the built environment might affect human health and wellbeing.The objective of this project is to develop a novel computational model that combines lighting simulation for buildings with our newly acquired understanding of the non-visual - also called non-image-forming - effects of light on human health to inform building design and operation. This reciprocal outreach effort will rely on an established collaboration between the PI, leading authority in daylighting and performance-driven design support at EPFL, Switzerland, and a neuroscientist and expert in circadian photoreception at the Harvard Medical School, USA. The integration of the non-visual effects of light into building science is not only relevant for promoting and maintaining health and wellbeing. Proper lighting may directly help to avoid accidents, increase safety, and reduce sleepiness; moreover, it may lead to better sleep quality, performance, and mood when applied over several weeks. Human lighting needs are certainly a key aspect of optimal healing and working environments, however no methods currently exist that can predict the potential health benefits and risks of ocular light exposure on occupants' physiological health. This gap needs to be filled both to advance lighting and building engineering knowledge so as to incorporate these fundamental aspects, and photobiology research so as to extend laboratory findings to real-world conditions.To address this challenge, it is necessary to develop methods (i) that take the spectral sensitivity of the non-visual system into account to describe how light spectrum, intensity, pattern, history, and timing directly affect humans; (ii) that take environmental uncertainties (i.e. occupant behavior, weather conditions, and blind control strategies) into account for a robust evaluation of (day)lighting performance. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in a combination of the two preceding aspects.We endeavor to provide a simulation-based framework for the consideration of human health and wellbeing in the early stages of the building design process. Through the integration of knowledge from photobiology, neuroscience, and sleep medicine, we propose a dynamic wavelength-dependent model to evaluate the non-visual effects of light based on user-defined performance objectives derived from occupants' profile and building type. Once the validity of the model has been demonstrated through an iterative validation process using laboratory and real-world data sets, we will integrate it into the building design process by developing a search algorithm for goal-based performance evaluation. A format for the representation of the results will also be developed to illustrate predicted performance. This step is fundamental to building a design support tool and ensuring its utility to the decision-making process, given the numerous tradeoffs that often need to be made among conflicting performance criteria when searching for the best design solutions. This project is the first to propose evidence-based health-driven lighting criteria using a dynamic wavelength-dependent model to predict the non-visual effects of light.Before integrating this new knowledge into practice, more experimental work is needed outside the controlled laboratory settings that address the dynamics of human non-visual responses with respect to our daily light exposure.

This method allows the authors to explore and demonstrate the impact of space time and sky condition on three novel daylight performance models developed to predict the effects of ocular light exposure using a human centric approach. Results for each model will be presented in parallel and then compared to discuss the need for a multi criteria assessment of daylight driven human responses in architecture.

It will be tangible. The latest VR systems rely heavily on visual feedback while even the best of physical reality, haptic interfaces, only deliver singular micro-vibrations as feedback. To render an effective exteroceptive understanding of the environment, we need a physical platform that can stimulate human skin in terms of all four mechano-receptor modules (pressure, vibration, temperature, and stretch).  A compliant platform that generates more diverse stimulations will improve human-machine experience. Such interactive interface with physical stimulation would not only enhance the way we communicate online but augment the learning, entertaining and physical training processes with various application in combination with visual and tactile feedback. The goal of The Surface for TAngible RealiTy, START, is to develop a moldable platform to transfer rich proprioceptive senses. To achieve this, we need 1) a modular physical interactive interface that 2) activates different tactile modalities upon command 3) over a distributed area. START will transform at will, transferring various tactile sensations of an environment / object via multiple scales and modes of physical stimulation.The objectives of the START project is to ultimately create a comprehensive design, develop materials and fabrication process for a device comprised of multiple functional layers with variable stiffness structures, sensors and active elements in an multi-DoF system that can explore: 1) auto-reconfiguration by demonstrating localized and distributed actuation to form various surface structures with its multi-active-DoF; 2) adjustable stiffness by activating localized and distributed variable stiffness capabilities of the reconfiguring surfaces; 3) distributed tactile feedback from network of distributed sensors and interfaces that can evaluate the tactile feedback. START is an application-driven project that faces three distinctive challenges. 1) Advances in design methodology to achieve structural compliance: We will study the structural and material-level effects of different thick-film-based functional layers (> 200 µm) on each other and on the discrete embedded components that include sensors, electronics, and smart materials. We will examine different design platforms in 2D and compliant mechanism to achieve the functional modularity and universality of the START.2) Novel actuation system for multi-scale and distributed actuation: We will investigate the applicability of the latest actuation systems in the low-profile, multi-DoF methods encompassing soft / smart actuators, and electrical motors. We will examine the distributed multi-DoF actuation system via simulation model and verify the distributed system controllability. 3) Advances in fabrication technology and material selection: We will extend beyond 2D and 2.5D fabrication methods that are often reserved for MEMS process.  We will explore smart composite materials fabrication processes, additive manufacturing, and various lithography techniques to derive structural and functional integrity.Concurrent physical feedback systems are mostly tied to visual or vibratory actuation only. The START project and its prototypes will revolutionize the data and tactile information transmission via its multi-actuated feedback system. START will enhance the user stimulation via multiple channels and modes of actuation that will transfer dense and complex exteroceptive data instantaneously.

Nevertheless, the lithium-ion battery starts to reach its limitation due to the recent concern about the availability of lithium. One alternative is provided by sodium, which may replace lithium in batteries. As for the lithium system, the alloys present the best energy density even if they are linked to a high volume change while cycling. The project will start with different electrode compositions also called electrode engineering of high-charge-density-materials (Sn, Sb and P), followed by a complete electrochemical study which will help us to understand the role of the binders, conductive additives and electrolyte additives in sodium-ion batteries. A complete interface characterization of the surface properties, as well as the electrochemical reaction mechanisms during the cycling in a sodium cell will shed light on the relationship between bulk and interface properties and cyclability of Sn, Sb and P materials. Understanding the relation between the surface properties and the cyclability will help us to clarify the reaction mechanism of the electrolyte decomposition and to determine the relationship between electrode formulation/volume expansion and specific charge. These studies will be mostly carried out via sophisticated operando high-resolution approaches, essentially combined operando XRD/XAS and combined operando Raman and infrared spectroscopy for the surface properties.The fact that we cannot explain the relationship between the volume expansion, the interface chemistry, and the specific charge of the electrode tends to limit the development of new generations of batteries.

In particular carbon dioxide is currently receiving increasing attention as a potential abundant, low cost renewable C1 feedstock. However, selective, energy efficient transformation of the very stable CO2 molecule remains one of the biggest challenges in synthetic chemistry today. None of the metal-based catalysts identified so far for the chemical or electrochemical reduction of CO2 have the efficiency and stability required for the development of a commercially viable process. In particular, the mechanisms that lead to carbon dioxide reduction often remain unidentified, rendering the optimization of systems difficult. Metal complexes that activate CO2 in a well-defined manner are therefore highly desirable, and an understanding of fundamental CO2 reactivity would be of great importance for a post-fossil fuel economy. As a result, fundamental research in this field is rapidly increasing worldwide. The high oxophilicity of f elements, and the flexibility of their coordination sphere, together with the wide range of sizes and redox potentials found among these ions render them attractive for the design of new molecular systems for CO2 fixation and reduction. Moreover, the greater covalent contribution to bonding found in low-valent uranium complexes as compared to lanthanides, associated to the large size and coordination number of uranium, can promote original reactivity that is impossible with d-block transition metals. The global objective of this project is to develop molecular complexes of f elements capable of promoting the transformation of small molecules, and CO2 in particular, with the long-term goal of developing new homogeneous catalysts for the chemical and electrochemical transformation of carbon dioxide. We will do this by investigating ancillary ligands that confer specific properties to the metal centers and by gaining a deep understanding of the chemistry, electronic structure and reactivity of original molecular and supramolecular complexes of f elements. This will allow us to optimize the molecular parameters controlling the reactivity of these systems with CO2. Not only will this work lead to results for CO2 activation, but more generally it will provide new avenues for the reductive chemistry of lanthanide ions and uranium, and synthetic access to new types of highly reactive intermediates. The project will involve the development of: new rational strategies to prepare highly reactive complexes of f elements ; a comparative study of uranium and lanthanide ions associated to these ligands; the identification of original synthetic routes for the preparation of new mononuclear and polynuclear lanthanide and uranium architectures capable of storing a high number of electrons; the design of new molecular systems capable of activating carbon dioxide and other small molecules; the characterization of new f element complexes with unusual ligand or metal centered reactivity; and the implementation of the developed systems in closed synthetic cycles.

SMMs and their mononuclear counterparts, single-ion magnets (SIMs), are attracting a lot of interest because of their high potential for molecular spintronics applications. In order to exploit the interesting properties of SMMs and SIMs in devices, which could be built based on molecule-inorganic heterostructures, a thorough understanding of the properties of the molecule-inorganic interface is needed. In several recent studies it has been observed that the magnetization relaxation times of TbPc2 SIMs are strongly reduced when the molecules are deposited on conducting surfaces such as metal single crystalline surfaces or on highly oriented pyrolitic graphite (HOPG). In their latest, currently submitted, work, the applicant and coworkers were able to show that the magnetization relaxation times of TbPc2 SIMs are drastically prolonged when an ultrathin insulating magnesium oxide film is inserted between the SIMs and the metallic substrate. In this project we will build up on these promising results. We aim at obtaining a thorough understanding of the influence of the substrate and the insulating film on the dynamic magnetic properties of surface deposited SIMs by a careful choice of substrate materials and decoupling films. To this end, an attractive option is to deposit submonolayers of TbPc2 molecules on sodium chloride ultrathin films with varying thickness. The sodium chloride films will be grown on metallic, e.g., Ag(100), and semiconducting (Ge(100)) surfaces. The semiconducting substrates further allow for the unique opportunity of tuning the charge carrier density, including the possibility of n-type and p-type doping. This shall yield information about the detailed interaction mechanism of the SIMs with the free charge carriers in the substrate, separated by the ultrathin insulating film acting as a tunnelling barrier. The studies will be performed by means of X-ray magnetic circular dichroism, scanning tunnelling microscopy at low temperatures and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy at the X-Treme and the PEARL beam lines of the Swiss Light Source, Paul Scherrer Institut, Switzerland. The synthesis and purification of the TbPc2 molecules will be carried out in the group of Prof. Mario Ruben at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany.The knowledge gained in the proposed studies shall lead to an improved control of the dynamic magnetic properties of surface adsorbed SMMs and SIMs. This project, if successful, has the potential to reach a milestone in the field of molecular spintronics with SMMs and SIMs, regarding the applicability of SMMs and SIMs in spintronics devices.",Synchrotron Lichtquelle Schweiz Paul Scherrer Institut,Villigen PSI,589890,0000-0001-7480-1271,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication;Research Infrastructures",Germany,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Operations on trapped-ion qubits have been demonstrated with error probabilities less than 0.1%, and systems of up to 20 ions are under experimental control. The major challenge in this field is to extend control to a large-scale device with many thousands of ions while retaining high precision. A promising avenue is to use micro-fabrication for producing ion traps, operating on many ions in an array of traps in parallel, and using transitions in which ions are moved through the array - this approach was proposed by Dave Wineland in 1998 and has become known as the “Quantum CCD” architecture. However utilizing these systems fully also requires new techniques for simplifying control implementations, particularly when delivering optical control fields to the ion and for supplying the potentials required for ion shuttling. In turn, new implementations provide new possibilities for control and measurement in quantum science.During the previous phase of our SNF grant, we have successfully realized a number of new types of quantum control of trapped ions. Working with active electronics inside a cryogenic vacuum system close to the trap itself, we have demonstrated “bang-bang” control quantum states of a single trapped-ion oscillator, by changing the trap position much faster than the ion can respond. We have produced states with up to 10000 quanta, and used these to verify the Franck-Condon factors far beyond what has been possible up until now. In this proposal, we will generate squeezed states of coupled oscillators and study the non-local entanglement which builds up between the ions. Cryogenic electronics will be extended to include continuous waveforms, giving rise to more flexible control which will allow fast separation of ions. In a second closely related line of research, we have demonstrated a new method for producing single-qubit quantum logic gates on the internal states of ions by transporting the ions through laser beams, departing from the traditional methods which involve modulation of the light fields. We will now extend this work in order to produce multi-qubit gates, demonstrating and benchmarking universal parallel transport-gate control. As a second pillar of the current proposal, we will pursue technological developments which can lead to multi-zone operation of traps as is required for algorithms including the implementation of quantum-error-correction codes.  Key elements which will be required in order to advance along this path are the ability to shuttle ions in multiple regions of a trap simultaneously, and to distribute optical fields to many zones. We will investigate new trap setups involving fixed laser fields distributed to several zones of a micro-fabricated trap, which are utilized by ion chains shuttled throughout the processing chip. Scalable traps will be built and tested using CMOS technologies, and through-hole machining using focused-ion-beams will be used to provide optical access through the chip. These technologies will be accompanied by shuttling routines in which ion chains can be broken up and recombined along the lines of a “Quantum CCD” architecture for scaling.I thank the SNF for providing funding which has been essential to our realizing these pioneering results at the forefront of an active field of research containing more than 40 groups worldwide.

On the first topic we will develop a new multi-grid version of the density matrix renormalization group algorithm that will substantially improve convergence properties especially in weakly doped systems. Combined with a new high performance massively parallel implementation of DMRG, we will apply this algorithm to simulations of the Hubbard model on wide ladders.The second topic concerns quantum annealing, which uses quantum devices, or simulations of them (in a classical method called simulated quantum annealing) to solve hard combinatorial optimization problems. This area of research has recently gained widespread controversial attention through the devices of the Canadian company D-Wave Systems. Based on our experiences with these devices we see a need to revisit prior results on the advantages of quantum annealing, systematically explore the powers of quantum annealing, and estimate the potentials of this technology for solving real-world application problems.Finally, we will address the question of how a future quantum computer may be used to solve interesting and important problems, especially in the area of strongly correlated materials. While already Feynman has argued that a quantum computer can efficiently simulate quantum models, we have recently seen that even on quantum computers, despite polynomial scaling the brute-force simulation of molecules or materials is still infeasible.

The interesting universal part of the entanglement spectrum is typically contained in the largest eigenvalues of the density matrix which can be obtained from the lower Renyi entropies through the Newton-Girard method. Obtaining the p largest eigenvalues (lambda(1) > lambda(2) ... > lambda(p)) requires a parallel circuit depth of O{[} p(lambda(1)/lambda(p))(p)] and O{[}p log( N)] qubits where up to p copies of the quantum state defined on a Hilbert space of size N are needed as the input. We validate this procedure for the entanglement spectrum of the topologically ordered Laughlin wave function corresponding to the quantum Hall state at filling factor nu = 1/ 3. Our scaling analysis exposes the tradeoffs between time and number of qubits for obtaining the entanglement spectrum in the thermodynamic limit using finite-size digital quantum computers.

By utilizing the assumption that the point data resides on a manifold, many algorithms based on the mathematical structure of manifolds have been proposed in the point-based graphics literature in the last decades. However, data acquired from the real world or simulated is becoming increasingly complex, exhibiting geometric structures that are impossible to be represented by a manifold. Current established geometry reconstruction, analysis and processing methods cannot handle this complex data due to their inherent assumption of manifold geometry, which is in contrast with the flexibility of point-based representations. This has been hindering the ability of the existing techniques to represent and operate on datasets such as those resulting from acquisition of complex geometry from the real world, physically-based elastic solid and fluid simulations, medical imaging, and geophysics.   In this project, we will develop fundamental analysis, reconstruction, and processing techniques for complex non-manifold geometry. We will first form novel analysis methods to learn and classify parts of the point cloud data according to the underlying structure, such as local manifolds of different dimensions, intersections, boundaries, and singularities. Following this analysis, reconstruction algorithms that can handle the extracted structures in a unified way will be developed. These will allow us to propose new methods for effective processing of the reconstructions via sampling, deforming, and filtering. By improving the efficiency of these operations with adaptive spatial data structures and parallelization, we will then develop interactive tools for manipulation of non-manifold geometry. These tools will be used in a system with visualization and rendering methods specifically designed for non-manifolds. Finally, the developed methods will be utilized to propose novel ways of processing complex geophysics and medical data. These techniques will allow us to alleviate some of the fundamental shortcomings of the existing geometry processing and data analysis methods.

Tuneability of the interface states by external field offers fascinating perspectives of TMO-based device applications. The central aim of the proposed project is to explore various spin-driven phenomena at the TMO interfaces and heterostructures as the fundamental basis for their future spintronics applications.Angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) is the main experimental tool to explore electronic structure resolved in electron momentum k. Crucial advantages of the soft-X-ray energy range around 1 keV in application to buried interfaces are enhanced probing depth and elemental/ chemical state specificity achieved with resonant photoemission. This is illustrated here with a few of our pioneering results including band structure and polaronic coupling of the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface states, SiO2/EuO/Si spin injectors, etc. Essential for these achievements has been the use of the ADRESS beamline at the SLS delivering the worldwide highest brilliance of soft X-rays.

It is also possible to trace molecular signaling between symbiotic partners with unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution.Here we propose to apply our sub-cellular imaging capabilities to study two fundamental processes in marine symbiotic organisms:Metabolic exchange between reef-building corals and their symbiotic dinoflagellate algaeHost-symbiont metabolic exchange is fundamental to the survival of shallow coral reefs in the nutrient-poor waters of the (sub-)tropics. Our primary interest in this project is to understand how, when, and to what extent symbiont-host metabolic exchanges are affected by current and future environmental stress, such as increasing sea-surface temperature and ocean acidification. Understanding the impact of environmental perturbations on the physiology of corals and the trophic relationships within the symbiotic association is key for defining thresholds for corals stress beyond which they cannot survive.Molecular signaling in the Hawaiian bobtail Squid-Vibrio fischeri symbiosis The Hawaiian bobtail squid establishes a stable, beneficial symbiosis with the bacteria Vibrio fischeri that populates its light organ during the first hours after hatching.

Biodiversity and phenology are critical indicators of ecosystem functioning and productivity that must be understood in terms of a changing environment. As key components of natural ecosystems through decomposition, parasitism and mutualism, fungi are particularly important to be understood in this respect. Fungal distributional dynamics in relation to abiotic drivers, such as environmental change, remain unresolved. The phenological responses of fungal fruiting to climate change have identified different fruiting trends and extremes at local- to regional-scales. A detailed picture of continental-scale response patterns of fungal fruiting phenology is, however, still lacking. High quality data of the most visible component of the fungal kingdom, i.e. mushroom fruit bodies, are limited in terms of temporal, spatial and taxonomic extent plus resolution. This resulted in a major barrier preventing analyses of fungal distributional patterns and responses to global change across large-scales. Statistical assessment likewise must be better integrated at cutting edge levels capable of appropriate analyses. It is thus imperative to not only focus on global change impacts of fungi across a wide range of spatiotemporal scales, but also to consider evidence at levels capable of addressing such key issues in ecology. Two major advances have recently helped dissolve statistical and data limitations that have been preventing further ecological studies of fungi and climate change. First, state-of-the-art statistical modeling approaches have become more accessible through server networks that are capable of running complex and novel statistical analyses. Second and even more importantly, the lack of well-replicated, long-term field-based data has been remedied by a newly generated meta-database that contains over seven million harmonized fungal records that are distributed across Europe and ready for utilization. This previously unprecedented level of quality data provides the ideal opportunity to fill in ecological gaps concerning fungi and global change. Here we propose Euro-FC, a timely initiative to carefully analyze the largest and most comprehensive compilation of data available in the field of mycological ecology. We plan innovative methodologies to investigate temporal and spatial dynamics of fungal fruiting across Europe. A harmonized fraction of the multi-decadal meta-dataset (~6.2 out of >7.0 million fungal records), which covers nine nations in central and northern Europe, will be utilized. This unique meta-dataset is ready for immediate utilization, especially for autumnal-based research on ecological effects of climate change, which describes a still neglected component when compared to similar research related to the spring season. Euro-FC will immediately address two pending topics in the field of mycological-based ecology: 1) How has fungal fruiting varied in Europe since the mid-20th century, and to what extent are phenological responses consistent with the phenology observed among other organisms, such as plants? 2) How did and does climate variability affect the observed patterns in continental-scale mushroom phenology, both at intra-annual and multi-decadal time-scales? The expected outcome is especially important because fungal fruiting, as well as possible associations with climatic drivers, has not yet been described at such scales. Species-based fruiting responses to environmental change will also provide novel insights into aspects of fungal productivity and diversity. Euro-FC therefore promises lucrative gains through two high impact peer-reviewed ISI publications, one for each objective (1 and 2), and with much potential to present original and exciting cross-disciplinary research at academic, educational and societal meetings.",Swiss Federal Research Inst.

Thue's famous result on densest circle packings (1892) and, more generally, Hilbert's 18th problem (1900) on the most economical packings and coverings of space by congruent copies of a fixed body set the fundamental theme for discrete geometry for more than a century. Much of the research was concentrated on density questions. The observation that the optimal arrangements are usually 'regular', periodic, or even lattice-like, gave impetus to the study of symmetry groups, and led to applications in crystallography and coding theory.The present proposal splits into four parts. In Parts I and II, we focus on combinatorial properties of 'irregular' arrangements. Is it true that every sufficiently 'thick,' possibly aperiodic, covering of the space with translates or homothets of a fixed convex set can be decomposed into two or more coverings? How economically can we cover space with incongruent objects, e.g., by slabs of different widths? We address the following 30 years old question of Makai and the applicant: Given an infinite sequence of slabs with divergent total width, can one always translate each slab without rotating it so as to cover a unit ball? The problem is related to Tarski's Plank Problem, to geometric set cover and 'hitting set' problems, an important area of research in discrete and computational geometry. Another classical question on arrangements is Sylvester's problem (1893): Given n lines in the plane, not all of which pass through the same point, is it true that one can always find an 'ordinary crossing', that is, a point that belongs to precisely two lines? Forty years later, this question was answered in the affirmative by Gallai and Melchior. It was a huge breakthrough in 2013 that Green and Tao, using algebraic techniques, showed that the minimum number of ordinary crossings induced by a set of n non-concurrent lines is n=2, as was conjectured by Dirac and Motzkin. The study of combinatorial properties of arrangements of points, lines or other curves and surfaces, has played a critical role in therapid development of computational geometry, robotics, computer graphics in the 1980s. The worst-case computational complexity of various geometric algorithms has turned out to depend more or less directly on the maximal 'combinatorial complexity' (maximum number of occurrences of certain combinatorial features) in an arrangement of a fixed size. In Part III, we propose to study incidence questions for arrangements of curves. Given a family F of n curves, no k of which are pairwise intersecting, what is the smallest number of subfamilies consisting of disjoint curves into which F can be decomposed? We also address the well-known Richter-Thomassen conjecture: Any family of n pairwise intersecting closed curves in the plane, no 3 of which pass through the same point, determines at least (1-o(1))n^2 intersection points.In Part IV, we propose to strengthen and explore the epsilon-net technique, one of the most powerful tools developed for decomposition, covering, and transversal problems. In particular, we plan to apply this method to the Danzer-Rogers problem: Can one pierce all convex sets of area epsilon within the unit square with O(1/epsilon) points? In addressing the above problems, we plan to build on our results achieved during the last grant period (2012-15).",Chaire de géométrie combinatoire EPFL - SB - MATHGEOM - DCG,Lausanne,90179,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication;Exchange of personnel",Hungary,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In general (i, ii) are mainly determined by the composition and structure of the food from its molecular to macroscopic length scale. Consequently knowledge about the structure disintegration process in the GI-tract is required. The digestive processing site of major importance for functional food component release and absorption (e.g. micro-/macro nutrients, antioxidants, trace elements) is the upper small intestine (duodenum), for which the preceding, most important preparatory digestive disintegration steps are executed in the stomach.Accordingly from a process engineering perspective the human stomach is (A) a “partially back-mixed semi-continuous bio-reactor” in which dispersing / mixing flow is generated by peristaltic waves induced by the stomach muscles and (B) a key player in the digestive disintegration process of the food. In case of an insufficient gastric preparation of the food, an optimum delivery of nutritional and health supporting functions in the duodenum would be impossible. Consequently optimization of food structure disintegration requires an improved quantitative understanding of the interplay of processed food structure with the fluid mechanical and biochemical disintegration mechanisms acting in the stomach. We expect this knowledge being a major prerequisite for optimized food processing upstream in the industrial manufacturing process if food products with tailored functional nutrition and health supporting characteristics shall be produced in the future. Consequently as main objective of this project proposal, we intend to investigate dynamic food disintegration characteristics in the human stomach taking the superimposed fluid mechanical and biochemical disintegration/digestion mechanisms into account. This will be approached from three directions: (i) by human gastric MRI inspired construction of an In Vitro Dynamic Human Stomach Model (IVDHSM) in which fluid dynamic and biochemical conditions can realistically be applied, (ii) by investigating the gastric velocity field, related particle tracks of model food particulates and their experienced stress-strain history, and (iii) by a coupled experimental and CDF-simulation based approach to quantify the food structure disintegration mechanisms. From this process-structure-property relationships will be quantified and by a reverse engineering approach be translated into a set of rules for optimized food structure design and processing in food industry.","Institut für Lebensmittelwissenschaften, Ernährung und Gesundheit ETH Zürich",Zürich,46197,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Research Infrastructures;Exchange of personnel",Switzerland,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While most sustainable transport solutions employ a lightweighting strategy- often based on fibre-reinforced plastics-to minimize energy demands, significant reductions in material and manufacturing costs are required in order for these solutions to be economically attractive.  Thermoplastic composites are particularly promising materials for high volume automotive applications due to their physical chemistry and mechanical properties.  However, innovations in both material chemistry and processing are required to meet the required standards of cycle time, cost, and quality that are acceptable to both the automotive industry and its consumers.This research proposal aims to overcome the processing issues associated with continuous fibre reinforced thermoplastic composites by developing bicomponent fibres as a novel intermediate material.  The increased degree of mingling is expected to reduce the time required for consolidation and thus may allow thermoplastic composites to be compatible with conventional stamp forming equipment used in sheet metal processing.  The proposed intermediate materials are expected to outperform preconsolidated organosheets and tapes in terms of drapeability and thereby expand stamp forming processes to include components of higher geometrical complexity.  Unlike existing processes that require fibre spreading to impregnate fibres with matrix material, the proposed solution would minimize damage to the reinforcement fibres and lead to high quality components that have sustainable end of life options through fibre and/or matrix recycling.  By striving for cost-effective sustainable manufacturing processes, this research pushes Switzerland’s competencies and helps retain the country’s position as a global leader in thermoplastic composite materials and processing.  With technical support from Dow Europe GmbH, the Laboratory of Advanced Fibres at EMPA St. Gallen, and the Institute of Polymeric Materials at the Leibniz Institute for Polymer Research Dresden, this interdisciplinary three year project embarks on basic research to understand the conditions necessary for producing a novel concept based on bicomponent fibres that is suitable for thermoplastic composite applications.  This work is expected to significantly contribute to the scientific understanding of the thermoplastic composite material research community as no previous work has been published on this topic.  In particular, the effects of the processing parameters on the manufacturing of the bicomponent fibres and the mechanical properties of the final consolidated components will be studied, and models that describe the consolidation of the material under rapid stamp forming processes will be developed.  This research proposal is aligned with the objectives of the Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research: Efficient Technologies and Systems for Mobility which was established in 2014 to support the transition from current fossil fuel based transportation systems to sustainable ones.

However, reconciling GR with the laws of quantum physics has been a long-standing problem. In the absence of direct experimental input, the research on quantum gravity is mostly driven by considerations of theoretical consistency. Still, it is believed that construction of a complete theory of quantum gravity will have profound impact on our understanding of physics and give concrete predictions that might be tested, in particular, using cosmological observations of the very early Universe.The most developed approach to quantum gravity is the string theory. However its predictive power is greatly reduced by the necessity to extend the spacetime dimensionality to 10 with the subsequent compactification of the extra dimensions. In this project we take another route which formulates quantum gravity as a perturbatively renormalizable field theory directly in 4 dimensions. This is achieved by postulating that at high energies the theory approximately obeys an anisotropic scale invariance, which acts differently on space and time coordinates. This construction explicitly violates Lorentz invariance which should emerge in this scenario as a low-energy property. Apart from phenomenological applications, gravity with anisotropic scaling has been proposed for holographic description of strongly coupled non-relativistic systems.This project aims to study the quantum properties of gravity with anisotropic scaling. It is planned to carry research along two main directions: (A) comprehensive perturbative investigation of renormalization group flows in various models of this class and (B) exploratory study of their behavior in the strongly coupled phase.

A significant fraction of this sedimentary carbon consists of organic macromolecules of biological origin. These organic macromolecules are the main energy sources of sediment microbial communities. Even though carbohydrates are likely to be ubiquitous in sediments, the contents, compositions, and sources of carbohydrates, which occur in adsorbed and particulate form and as essential components of living sediment microbes, are poorly known. Little knowledge also exists on the compositions of carbohydrates that are dissolved in sediment porewater, even though these carbohydrates offer important information on the sources and diagenetic changes of sedimentary carbohydrates, and on organic matter cycling in general.In this project we will significantly expand the understanding of the role of sedimentary carbohydrates in the global carbon cycle. In the first part, we will develop a sequential extraction method for the maximization of carbohydrate recovery from diverse biomass and sedimentary samples. In the second part, we will determine the contents, chemical compositions, and sources of sedimentary carbohydrates across a diverse range of surface to subsurface sediment types from lacustrine to open-ocean locations. We will thereby reveal global patterns in the contributions of carbohydrates to buried organic matter. Furthermore, by comparing patterns in carbohydrate compositions and sources across samples differing greatly in geographic location, in situ temperature, sediment age, sediment depth, water depth, redox chemistry, trophic state, microbial activity, microbial community composition, and macrofaunal bioturbation, we will produce important new insights into the controls on carbohydrate degradation and preservation in sediments. In the third part, we will quantify the relative contributions and chemical compositions of five different quantitatively important and biologically relevant carbohydrate pools (dissolved, adsorbed, extra-polymeric, biomass-bound, particulate) across several locations and sediment depths. In so doing, we will identify the biologically cycled carbohydrate pools and contribute to a better mechanistic understanding of carbohydrate preservation in aquatic sediments. Carbohydrate analyses will be done by spectrophotometry, gas chromatography combined with flame-ionization detection, mass spectrometry, isotope-ratio mass spectrometry, pyrolysis, as well as high-performance anion-exchange chromatography combined with pulsed amperometric detection. This project will considerably advance our knowledge on the contribution of carbohydrates to Earth’s largest carbon sink. By identifying patterns in carbohydrate contents, chemical compositions, and sources across a wide range of surface and subsurface sample types, we will contribute to a better understanding of the factors that control whether sedimentary organic matter is microbially remineralized or preserved over geologic time. The data on carbohydrate distributions and compositions of different carbohydrate pools will furthermore enable detailed comparisons to data on sediment biogeochemistry and microbial communities, which will in turn lead to new insights into the energy sources and survival mechanisms of microbial life from surface to subsurface sediments in lacustrine and oceanic environments.",Departement Umweltsystemwissenschaften ETH Zürich IBP / D-USYS,Zürich,644098,0000-0002-2046-8028,Research Infrastructures,Switzerland,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The catalyst is a complex composite of various components shaped in spheres of about 100 microns. Since large molecules must react on the surface of the catalytic particles encompassed in the pre-shaped catalyst bodies, these pre-shaped bodies are porous. Up to now the porosity of individual particles has not been visualized or quantified, and there is no clear relation to catalytic performance. We propose to visualize the pores in the fluidized catalyst cracking (FCC) catalyst at all relevant length scales, from sub-nm  by electron tomography, to nanometer by X-ray ptychographic tomography, and micron by transmission X-ray tomography. All of these methods are available at ETH Zurich and the Swiss Light Source at the Paul Scherrer Institute. Of particular interest are current developments made in the field of X-ray ptychography, which has by now the resolving power to assess the three-dimensional pore structure of realistic catalysts and to bridge the resolution gap between electron microscopy and transmission X-ray microscopy. The project’s aim is to quantify in detail pore size, size distribution, and connectivity at length scales from 100 microns down to sub-nanometer and correlate these to macroscopic measurements on these quantities and catalytic activity. The combination of X-ray fluorescence and measuring the complex-valued index of refraction, i.e., both the materials’ absorption and phase advance, allows the elemental distribution to be identified within individual FCC bodies. This is of particular relevance to spent catalysts, which contains deposited metals, such as Ni and V, in addition to changed pore structure by coke deposition and change in crystallinity of zeolitic compounds.One PhD student will perform the synchrotron measurements and macroscopic characterization of commercially available FCC catalysts.

The subject has a central role in mathematics with connections to number theory, representation theory, and topology. Moduli questions in algebraic geometry concern the behavior of varieties as the coefficients of the defining polynomials vary. At the end of the 20th century, several fundamental links between the algebraic geometry of moduli spaces and path integrals in quantum field theory were made. The integrals were, in several cases, interpreted as top intersection pairings on moduli spaces.  I propose here to study the full cohomology and cycle theory of several moduli spaces in algebraic geometry with connections to mathematical physics, not only the top intersection pairings. The  outcome will be a much better understanding of the geometry. Moreover, the cohomology rings will likely be important and beautiful new mathematical structures.My main focus will be on the moduli spaces of curves, maps, sheaves, and $K3$ surfaces. Striking progress has been made in the past three years: Pixton's conjectures governing tautological classes on the moduli space of curves, the proof of the Gromov-Witten/Pairs correspondence for complete intersections, and the calculation of the Picard groups of the moduli of K3 surfaces have all advanced the subject. The area has entered a stage where rapid and significant progress is possible. My proposed approach to these questions uses a mix of new geometries and new techniques. The virtual fundamental class (based on the deformation-obstruction theory of the moduli spaces) plays an basic underlying role. For the moduli space of curves, the introduction of r-spin geometries and the Gromov-Witten theory of orbifolds have been crucial in recent progress. The Givental-Teleman classification of semisimple Cohomological Field Theories (CohFTs) is new and powerful tool which will be used here systematically in the study of tautological rings. The degeneration formula for Gromov-Witten and stable pairs theories will be applied for the first time to the Virasoro constraints in higher dimensions.

The plate tectonics regime of our Earth is unthinkable without the deep cycling of volatiles and even if H2O is their main component, CO2/CO/CH4 and N2/NH3 play an important role, in particular where life is concerned.On the early Earth, carbon and nitrogen (and any other volatile) are repartitioned between a dense atmosphere and the metal and silicate melts of the magma ocean. Similarly, during modern magmatism N+C partition between silicate melts and a gas phase; to constrain these equilibria by high pressure experiments is the target of project B. Carbon in the oceanic lithosphere is either deeply subducted or transferred to the mantle in the subarc region (or shallower) and in part resurfaced through mantle derived arc magmatism. Project A is mainly concerned with the carbon transfer efficiency at subarc depths, investigating experimentally H2O- and CO2-solubilities in melts derived from the subducted crust. Project C constrains carbon isotope fractionation between the mobile phase (fluid or carbonatite) and residual carbon minerals by high pressure experiments. As isotopes are used to determine the provenance of carbon (primordial, mantle, surface derived), understanding the isotopic behavior during recycling will allow characterizing processes involved in the deep C-recycling and formation of e.g. diamonds. A: Volatile solubility in and viscosity of high pressure granitic melts (1-4 GPa)  (postdoc, Dr. Ineke Wijbrans)This project addresses (i) CO2 + H2O solubilities in high pressure granitic melts developing from subducting slabs and (ii) their viscosity, such constraining melt migration from the slab to the mantle. (iii) These experiments should also resolve the longstanding question of (second) supercriticality between granitic melts and fluids. Solubility and viscosity data of high-pressure granitic melts are crucially lacking and will be obtained by using the unique high pressure centrifuging piston cylinder: The often unquenchable melts will be separated from the fluids by centrifuging and bulk-analyzed. As long as glasses are obtained H and C will be measured at the Swiss-SIMS, Lausanne. Separation will inform on whether two liquid phases coexist at high P and T. Falling sphere experiments (mostly in the centrifuge) will determine viscosities of high-H2O granites. All together, we will constrain the transfer of carbon from hot melting slabs to the mantle and quantify how much residual carbon may be subducted to deeper mantle domains. B: N (and C) fractionation between an early atmosphere and metal and silicate melts(PhD Iris Speelmanns)This project investigates the fractionation of N and C between a gas phase and a silicate or metal melt as well as the partitioning of N between metal and silicate melts to high pressures. The experimental results will allow modeling N and C sequestration from the atmosphere into primordial mantle and core material and to understand the related isotope fractionation. Experiments at 100-2000 bar provide sufficient quantities of N and C for mass spectrometry. The gas phase will be analyzed by gas chromatography and its speciation thermodynamically modeled as a function of fO2. The primary purpose is to understand the N (and C) redistribution at the point in time where the (reduced) Earth is fully accreted. Because of the technical similarity of the suitable experiments and analytics, this project also addresses basalt degassing at mid-ocean ridges and ocean islands (mildly oxidizing).C: High temperature isotope fractionation of carbon between C-minerals and fluids or melts (PhD Nico Küter)Recycling of carbon during subduction, its mobilization in fluids or melts and redox re-precipitation in the mantle provides ample opportunity for isotope fractionation, each time in the order of several ‰. This project investigates equilibrium fractionation between C-minerals (graphite, diamond, carbonates, carbides) and fluids or carbonatite melts. C-O-H fluids in equilibrium with graphite (or another C-mineral) with compositions from almost pure CH4 to H2O-CO2-only are extracted from the capsules by a newly constructed device operating under vacuum and including the capacity to moderately heat the sample.

It is therefore not surprising that they are the best sources of drugs and drug leads. In spite of the great success of natural products in the history of drug discovery, they are significantly underrepresented in current small molecule libraries due presumably to: a) extremely low natural abundance, hence limited supply; b) enormous difficulties in structural modifications due to their molecular complexity; c) lack of practical synthesis.As a strong ally of natural products, total synthesis often provides intermediates and chemical tools that allow modification of the structure of natural products. Such changes can improve biological and physical properties of the parent compound, help understanding the structural-activity relationship (SAR) and eventually identifying a simplified, hence more accessible, analogue with equal or even better pharmacological properties for drug development. Recent crowning achievements in this arena are the development of Taxotère® and eribulin (Halaven®) both are marketed anti-cancer drugs. On the other hand, the analogue synthesis can also play important role in identifying the natural product’s macromolecular target.Traditionally, organic compounds are synthesized via stepwise construction of individual chemical bond found in the target molecules with a work-up procedure after each transformation. The increase of molecular complexity per operation with such a strategy is therefore incremental. Searching for multiple-bond forming reactions and minimizing non-constructive transformations is therefore of increasing importance in designing of synthesis strategy/tactics. Such strategy could not only shorten the synthetic sequence, but also enhance the aesthetic appeal of the synthesis endeavor.

Coupled with continued increase in human lifespan over the last two centuries, age-related diseases are now among the global leading causes of deaths. Ageing is a complex process, marked by a progressive functional and physiological decline that culminates in death. Importantly, ageing is associated with increased morbidity and is one of the main risk factors of human diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, drawing a significant fraction of government spending in industrialized countries. Without a concomitant or faster increase in the length of healthy life, longer lifespan would translate to higher health care spending. In this regard, a better understanding of the biology of ageing has the potential to delay the onset of age-related diseases, extend healthy life expectancy, and thus reduce the socioeconomic burden of greying population. How ageing causes or increases vulnerability to many different diseases is still an open question. The complexity of the ageing process has motivated applying a systems-oriented approach to ageing research in the last decade, involving the creation and analysis of network of biological interactions among cellular components. The goal of our project is to study how ageing affects metabolism and vice versa, how metabolic perturbations such as dietary restriction (DR) modulate the ageing process. The project is timely considering the well-established close connection between ageing and metabolism, and the comprehensive knowledge on metabolic networks in human and other model organisms, that has been generated in the post-genomic era. Here, we will leverage the recently curated human genome-scale metabolic model and integrate available omics data on age-related molecular changes using mathematical modeling. By employing metabolic network analysis, we will shed light on metabolic alterations during normal ageing and under DR. Subsequently, by mapping these metabolic alterations to human conditions, we will then be able to provide possible mechanistic explanations for the ageing process. Our use of constrained-based models (CBMs) deviates from existing network-based analyses of ageing that are predominantly based on protein-protein interactions. Such deviation is apt for the purpose of our study since CBMs will enable us to predict the metabolic effects of network perturbations (e.g. by gene knock-down or knock-out). In the second part of the project, we will use CBMs to identify potential genes or combinations of genes whose deletions would modulate metabolic changes during normal ageing. The validity of these genes in terms of modifying the ageing process (ageing rate) will be tested using high-throughput lifespan study on nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, assisted by microfluidics technology.",Institut für Chemie- und Bioingenieurwissenschaften ETH Zürich,Zürich,591243,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",France,Not peer-reviewed,Editors (non peer-reviewed),Biological Networks,,Published,2018,978-3-03897-434-5,10.3390/books978-3-03897-434-5,https://www.mdpi.com/books/pdfview/book/1057,,"MDPI,Basel, Switzerland",,,,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The integration of III-V semiconductors on Si is key to open up new possibilities for electronic and optoelectronic devices and thus new on-chip functionalities.

The overall goal of this project is to achieve controlled growth of III-V nanowire heterostructures directly on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers with high crystal-, surface-, and interface quality. The basis to achieve this significant goal is a recently developed methodology called template-assisted epitaxy which has enabled precisely-controlled growth of high-quality vertical III-V nanowires on Si substrates with any orientation. This method will now be applied to SOI wafers to enable growth of nanowires, which are ideally suited for various applications such as high-speed and low-power III-V transistors, integrated photodetectors and light-emitting devices, even lasers. The focus of this project is on deepening the understanding of III-V nanoscale epitaxy processes, on investigating the correlation between growth parameters and crystal morphology, as well as composition and defect formation.

In contrast to the traditional approach of Combinatorial Optimization Problems, such as Vehicle Routing, SCOPs encompass stochastic information about the problem. This results to more realistic models as in reality many events or quantities can be approximated probabilistically more accurately (e.g. travel times) due to unpredictable factors such as traffic or weather conditions. In this work, we focus mainly on Stochastic Combinatorial problems that encompass some type of a deadline. Examples of this type of problems arise often in Vehicle Routing or Scheduling. Examples from the Vehicle Routing literature are the Orienteering Problem with Stochastic Travel and Service Times (OPSTS) and the Probabilistic Traveling Salesman Problem with Deadlines (PTSPD). In the OPSTS, a company has to select a subset of customers to serve before a global deadline while in the PTSPD, a company has to serve customers and each one has a deadline after of which a penalty is incurred. Also, each customer will be served or not in each tour with some probability. Another example from scheduling is the Resource-Constrained project scheduling problem.Stochasticity makes the problem models more difficult to solve than its non-stochastic counterparts. Exact methods for solving them work only for very small problem instances and designing efficient (meta)heuristics for these problems is also a challenge. One of the challenging aspects can also be the computation of the objective function of the problem as there are several problems with no known closed-form expression or hard-to-compute objective functions. One of the ways to deal with such objective functions is to approximate them using Monte Carlo sampling. Metaheuristics based on Monte Carlo Sampling have become state-of-the-art approaches for the Probabilistic Traveling Salesman Problem (PTSP), the Probabilistic Traveling Salesman Problem with Deadlines (PTSPD) and the Orienteering Problem with Stochastic Travel and Service Times (OPSTS). However, because of the way Monte Carlo sampling works, in the solution areas around the deadline is probable to occur, larger errors occur that then propagate to the rest of the solution, with a deterioration of the overall solution cost estimation. This can be mitigated by mixing different objective functions (e.g. exact methods) along with sampling-based methods in order to compute the objective value. In this project, we study which methods to use and how to combine them in order to minimize the total error while preserving or even enhancing the performance of sampling-based metaheuristics, leading to sampling-based hybrid methods. One other goal of this project is to discover other classes of Stochastic Vehicle Routing Problems which can be solved with metaheuristics based on hybrid Monte Carlo Sampling. For example, the class of chance-constrained Vehicle Routing Problems seems to be an interesting candidate for this research. Here the objective function is stochastic, and stochastic as well as non-stochastic constraints are used. The study of more advanced sampling techniques is yet another goal of this project. While the current approaches mainly use basic sampling techniques, more advanced and elaborate techniques can lead to further improvements of those approaches. A final target is the investigation of the use of GPGPUs. Coupling this technology with sampling-based methods appears to be very promising since the calculation of many samples (without jumps or branches) in parallel is the situation where GPGPUs perform best, and accidentally this is exactly what happens with sampling-based methods.","Facoltà di scienze informatiche  Università della Svizzera italiana, USI",Lugano,36356,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",Germany,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Researchers of many different fields (from psychology, pattern recognition, neuroscience, computer graphics and computer vision) have attempted to create and understand face recognition systems.One of the most challenging tasks in automated face recognition is the matching between face images acquired in heterogeneous environments. Use-cases can cover matching of faces in unconstrained scenarios (e.g. at a distance), with long time lapse between the probe and the gallery and faces sensed in different modalities, such as thermal infrared or near infrared images (NIR) against visible spectra images (VIS). Successful solutions to heterogeneous face recognition can extend the reach of these systems to covert scenarios, such as recognition at a distance or at nighttime, or even in situations where no face even exists (forensic sketch recognition).The key difficult in matching faces from heterogeneous conditions is that images of the same subject may differ in appearance due to changes in image modality (e.g. between VIS images and NIR images, between VIS images and sketches images) introducing high intra-class variations. With these variations, a direct comparison between samples generally results in poor matching accuracy. Heterogeneous face recognition algorithms must develop facial representations invariant to these changes. In this proposal, we present three strategies to cope with these challenges.We will start by investigating manifold learning techniques. The key idea of manifold learning is to learn a joint mapping that project images, of different modalities, into a subspace where these projections can be compared directly with a simple distance function.As a second step, we will investigate generative approaches for face recognition. Generative approaches compute the likelihood of an observation (face image) or a set of observations given the a statistical model of the subject. In this environment, cross-sensor or hetereogeneous matching can be regarded as a session variability information the model needs to cope with, compensating for them during the enrollment and probing.Finally, a combination of both techniques will be investigated. This combination can be carried out in two different ways. At first, we will investigate score level fusion between the joint map learned with manifold learning approaches and the generative approach. We will then investigate the possibility to provide face images projected with the manifold learning techniques as input the generative face recognition systems.",Idiap Research Institute Martigny,Martigny,126018,,Publication,Brazil,Peer-reviewed,Proceedings (peer-reviewed),Cross-eyed 2017: Cross-spectral iris/periocular recognition competition,"Sequeira Ana F.,  Chen Lulu,  Ferryman James,  Wild Peter,  Alonso-Fernandez Fernando,  Bigun Josef,  Raja Kiran B.,  Raghavendra R.,  Busch Christoph,  de Freitas Pereira Tiago,  Marcel Sebastien,  Behera Sushree Sangeeta,  Gour Mahesh,  Kanhangad Vivek",Published,2017,,10.1109/btas.2017.8272762,,2017 IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB),"IEEE,2017",2017 IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB),,,,,2017 IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB),"Denver, CO",This work presents the 2nd Cross Spectrum Iris/Periocular Recognition Competition (Cross Eyed2017).

Based on only a few genuine specimens, signature verification is a challenging task even for humans. Automatic verification systems are still far from human performance but their accuracy has improved significantly in the past decade, making it possible to rely on machines in some restricted cases or to support human experts.Most of the current methods for automatic signature verification are based on feature vector representation and statistical classification, either taking into account local or global features. Known limitations of this approach include the inability to capture the global structure of the signatures and the relations between their subparts in a standardized way. Graph based representation and structural matching can overcome this limitation by providing a more intuitive, powerful, and flexible mechanism for formally representing and comparing handwritten signatures.However, one of the main challenges in graph based pattern recognition is the high computational complexity involved in structural matching. Recently, we have introduced a promising approximation framework for graph edit distance based on substructure assignment. This framework is able to compare arbitrary graphs efficiently with cubic or, more recently, even quadratic time complexity, which makes graph matching applicable to a wide range of real-world pattern recognition problems.Based on this efficient graph matching framework, we propose in this project to explore the use of graphs and the potential benefits of structural pattern recognition methods for signature verification. First, we will derive graph models for signatures and adapt the matching framework to signature verification. In order to further improve the verification accuracy, we will also attempt to embed signature graphs in vector spaces, which allows statistical classification, and the combination of multiple classifiers profiting from the complementary properties of the statistical and structural approach.A central aspect of the envisaged structural verification system will be to include a signature stability model that distinguishes stable from variable subparts based on the analysis of genuine reference samples. Besides potential improvements in the verification accuracy, such a stability model provides a novel graph based interpretation of signatures, which can be valuable for supporting human experts.",Institut für Wirtschaftsinformatik Hochschule für Wirtschaft Fachhochschule Nordwestschweiz,Olten,536584,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",Canada,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),Combining graph edit distance and triplet networks for offline signature verification,"Maergner Paul,  Pondenkandath Vinaychandran,  Alberti Michele,  Liwicki Marcus,  Riesen Kaspar,  Ingold Rolf,  Fischer Andreas",Published,2019,,10.1016/j.patrec.2019.06.024,,Pattern Recognition Letters,,Pattern Recognition Letters,125,,527,533,Pattern Recognition Letters,,Offline signature verification is a challenging pattern recognition task where a writer model is inferred using only a small number of genuine signatures.

These self-assembled materials constitute a versatile alternative to covalent polymers for many applications (biomedical, cosmetics, foodstuff, etc.) thanks to their bio-inspired and superior properties (e.g., self-healing) and their dynamic and responsive nature. However, the rules to design these systems are not well understood. The major challenge is to understand how small modifications in the monomer structure can produce large changes in the self-assembled material. This is fundamental to design supramolecular polymers in which the final properties are controlled by the molecular information stored in the self-assembling units. Usually, libraries of self-assembling molecules are created and the resulting supramolecular materials are evaluated in an assay through an expensive and repetitive experimental process. Nevertheless, in water solution it often extremely difficult, if not impossible, to obtain clear understanding of the interactions governing the self-assembly process. Molecular modeling is a fundamental support to the study of supramolecular polymers. Recently, we have developed a modeling approach based on all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to understand the effect of small changes in the monomer structure on the dynamics of the supramolecular polymer in water (Nat. Commun. 2015, 6, 6234): a direct structure/dynamics/property relationship. Focusing on 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxamide (BTA) monomers, a synthetic analog self-assembling into supramolecular fibers in water, our models demonstrated optimal consistency with the experiments and allowed for a detailed characterization of the supramolecular fibers and of the interactions controlling self-assembly in water. Comparison between fibers of achiral or chiral BTA monomers provided a direct link between the chiral information stored into the monomers and supramolecular polymer helicity, persistency and dynamic behavior. Together with a remarkable advance in the field, this preliminary study also proposed new exciting questions: How can we modify the monomers to control the final structure and the dynamic behavior of the supramolecular polymer? How can we transmit the structural information stored in the monomers to the supramolecular polymer to obtain controlled macroscale structural and dynamic properties in water? The aim of this project proposal is to expand our simulation strategy to model the effect of two key parameters on the behavior of the water-soluble supramolecular polymer:•Changing the monomers structure: Carbohydrate-decorated BTAs offer an example of achiral core decorated with an intrinsically chiral functionality, and the promise for highly-soluble and biocompatible supramolecular materials •Supramolecular copolymers: Mixing achiral and chiral monomers (BTAs) into a supramolecular copolymer provides an interesting case to study how the monomers transmit the chiral information to the supramolecular material in water We devised a computational approach to tackle these two points in a systematic way. The modeling strategy presented herein will allow for a multi-scale description of the mechanisms that govern the transmission of the information stored into the monomers to the supramolecular material, controlling the final properties. The computational effort required for this project will benefit from the precious collaboration of the experimental group of Prof. E.W. “Bert” Meijer (TU/e, Eindhoven, NL), a world-leading research group in the field.

Here we study supramolecular copolymerizations by examining the mechanism and time scales associated with the incorporation of new monomers in benzene 135 tricarboxamide (BTA) based supramolecular polymers. The BTA molecules in this study all contain three tetra(ethylene glycol) chains at the periphery for water solubility but differ in their alkyl chains that feature either 10 12 or 13 methylene units. C10BTA does not form ordered supramolecular assemblies whereas C12BTA and C13BTA both form high aspect ratio supramolecular polymers. First we illustrate that C10BTA can mix into the supramolecular polymers based on either C12BTA or C13BTA by comparing the temperature response of the equilibrated mixtures to the temperature response of the individual components in water. Subsequently we mix C10BTA with the polymers and follow the copolymerization over time with UV spectroscopy and hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry experiments. Interestingly the time scales obtained in both experiments reveal significant differences in the rates of copolymerization. Coarse grained simulations are used to study the incorporation pathway and kinetics of the C10BTA monomers into the different polymers. The results demonstrate that the kinetic stability of the host supramolecular polymer controls the rate at which new monomers can enter the existing supramolecular polymers.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Torrent processes, including debris flow, hyperconcentrated flow and fluvial sediment transport, are a particularly de-structive form of mountain hazards causing loss of life and considerable damages on buildings and infrastructure. This development as well as scientific findings demonstrate that risk associated with mountain hazards cannot be reduced by focusing solely on the hazardous processes. Within an integrated risk management, vulnerability is a key factor and also the main source of uncertainty in risk reduction. Vulnerability in this context is defined as a relationship between process intensity and associated loss. Currently, few studies proposed methods for an em-pirical quantification of physical vulnerability to torrent processes, nonetheless, considerable gaps still exist re-garding a lack of data for highly destructive events in all datasets, the amount of data of the individual case stud-ies as well as their comparability regarding data gathering, all factors are essential for robust statistical analysis. Moreover, only limited analysis and insights exist on best-performing intensity parameters, other main influenc-ing factors on vulnerability and possible correlation between these factors. Our knowledge about spatial compo-nents influencing vulnerability is restricted and spatial and geostatistical analyses in this context are still in their infancy. The first part of the proposed project focuses on the extension of existing studies for the empirical quantification of vulnerability to torrent processes by compiling comprehensive data on the degree of loss, process intensity, building and surrounding characteristics from five highly destructive torrents event in Switzerland. Additionally, a standardised and homogenised master-database on vulnerability data including existing case studies from Aus-tria, Italy and Switzerland will be established. Consequently using this master-database, one main focus is on deducing different vulnerability functions for the integration in mountain hazard risk analysis and highlighting the inherent uncertainties as well as possible regional differences. Further analysis using a double generalised linear model will allow us to gain further knowledge of the influence of different parameters (e.g. building characteris-tics) on the degree of loss as well as on the spread of data. The second main focus is on the analysis of spatial effects influencing the physical vulnerability concentrating on global and local autocorrelation of spatial parame-ters as well as of potential spatial clusters of degree of loss and other contributing factors. A comprehensive vali-dation procedure will allow to detect the simplest but also most robust function or model for physical vulnerability to torrent processes.The results of the proposed project will contribute to a better prediction of the risk caused by torrent events by gaining insights in inherent uncertainties as well as reducing these uncertainties by the improved database.

It is therefore obvious that an analysis and quantification of vulnerability is required for successful disaster risk reduction. The need for vulnerability assessment is crucial due to the effects of climate change as well as the socio economic dynamics that may directly impact vulnerabilities and coping capacities of affected communities. Vulnerability is multidimensional (physical social economic etc.) however the dimension which is mainly related to the direct costs and threat to human lives is the physical one. We focus here on the physical vulnerability of buildings subject to torrential hazards occurring in small and steep mountain catchments. These processes include fluvial sediment transport debris floods and debris flows. Furthermore we included flash flood hazards if these are related to torrential catchments. Physical vulnerability to torrential hazards in mountain areas is a topic that has been under scientific investigation over the last 20 years. Several methods to assess physical vulnerability of buildings towards flash floods debris flows and hyper concentrated flows can be found in the literature. The plethora of methods and approaches may be classified under the following three categories: vulnerability matrices vulnerability curves and vulnerability indices. We provide a short review of these methods which became available over the last decade and which dominate the scientific debate in mountain hazard risk management giving an emphasis to vulnerability curves.

The first year of the project resulted in a publication in SAT 2015, a premier conference in constraint solving, and the first cloud-based and multithreaded implementations of a parallel SMT solver using novel paralellization strategies and search space partitioning. The results so far confirm the viability of the ideas presented in the original proposal. We have found the experience obtained in the process extremely useful in further strengthening the continuation outlined already in the first proposal. Since the original proposal was funded only partially we have made certain adjustments to the extension, reformulating some of the goals for this proposal.Software has a central role in modern society: Almost all of todays industry depends critically on software either directly in the products or indirectly during the production, and the safety, cost-efficiency and environmentally friendliness of infrastructure, including the electric grid, public transportation, and health care, rely increasingly on correctly working software. The growing role of software in society means that the consequences of software faults can be catastrophic, and as a result proving the correctness of software is widely thought to be one of the most central challenges for computer science, the related work having been acknowledged with prestigious recognitions such as the Turing award.Verifying complex software can be extremely expensive. We propose to address the challenges of software verification with an extensive parallel model checking framework able to scale to the massive amounts of processing power offered by computing clouds. We will use the framework to study the parallelization of key aspects of model checking, including the underlying SMT solver used as a reasoning engine, model-checking algorithms, and widely applicable related technologies such as interpolation. The results of the framework will be used in two  flagship applications, a parallel SMT solver, and a parallel software model checker. We expect the research to improve the current stateof-the-art not only in model checking, but also in other applications where constraint solving has been successful.",Istituto di sistemi informatici (SYS) Facoltà di scienze informatiche,Lugano,524108,0000-0002-8872-4913,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",United States of America,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Cretaceous-Neogene Patagonian fold-thrust belt and the Magellanes foreland Basin in South America consist of a thick sequence (> 4000m) of turbidites, sandstones and clay rich layers which were deposited on a quasi-oceanic and continental crust. The stratigraphic sequence records the corresponding tectonic settings from an Upper Jurassic shallow marine to deep-water sedimentary system and up to a Tertiary shallow, deltaic and river depositional systems.  The primary sedimentary features of the sequence are well studied, however, a profound analysis of the regional low-grade metamorphic/locally hydrothermal history related to the thermal development of the basin in response to thrusting, burial, exhumation and intrusive activity has not yet been studied in detail. This projects aims to analyze clay mineral associations and the rank or coalification of carbonaceous material in the stratigraphic record of a fault-thrust belt spanning a time period from Upper Jurassic to the Tertiary. The thermal evolution and the complex prograde and retrograde clay mineral associations related to burial, thrusting, overburden, source origin and to the hydrothermal activity of the well investigated intrusive Torres del Paine Complex will be studied using the illite and chlorite crystallinity techniques (“reaction progress”). In addition, the coalification of carbonaceous material in the various rock lithologies will be determined. It is anticipated to constrain a carefully selected suite of clay minerals by applying the K/Ar and/or Ar/Ar techniques. The obtained information will contribute to a better understanding of the thermal development of basins, fold-and-thrust belts, the source area of the sediments and the influence of hydrothermal fluids on the reaction progress of clay minerals and the coalification of organic matter.

The combined use of illite crystallinity  (Kübler index) polytype quantification and  K Ar dating of illite fractions (<0.2 <2 and  2–6 μm) is a powerful tool in constraining the  missing time gap between the emergent foldand   thrust belt formation and early Miocene  uplift of the Magallanes Basin. Four distinct  periods of illite growth were identified  based on their K Ar ages and degree of regional  metamorphism: (1) early Cenomanian  (98 Ma) illite crystallization (2) widespread  early Campanian (ca. 80 Ma) long lasting  burial illitization processes under anchizonal  metamorphic conditions (3) a significant  period of illite formation in the early Paleocene  (ca. 60 Ma) and (4) a late stage of illite  growth in the early Eocene (55–46 Ma) under  epizonal conditions. Based on K Ar fine fraction  ages and Kübler index values we propose  to subdivide the internal domain along  the Río Nutria and Río Rincon thrust into a  thrust zone with maximum rock uplift in the  west and a foreland vergent imbricate thrust  zone in the east.  The earliest indication for the emergent  fold and thrust belt formation in the hinterland  is documented in a metapelitic clast  (sample 14 9 <2 μm) within the Upper Cretaceous  Cerro Toro conglomerate which  yielded a K Ar cooling age of 98.3 ± 1.2 Ma  and an epizonal Kübler index value of 0.24  Δ°2Ɵ. After a certain period of geological  quiescence an interval of major thrusting  and rock uplift occurred between ca. 60 and  46 Ma. The west dipping Río Nutria and Río  Rincon thrusts record the onset of fold andthrust  belt activity which can be placed close  to 60 Ma. In the western part of the internal  domain thrusts remained active and associated  structural uplift is recorded until 46 Ma  by K Ar illite cooling ages. Flexural subsidence  driven by thrust sheet loading in the  internal domain was responsible for the eastward  migration of the foreland depocenter  and a rapid increase in sedimentation rate  along the monoclinal belt.  Our results prove a synchronous onset  of thick skinned thrusting between 49°S  and 55°S and suggest constant convergence  rates of the Patagonian arc against the adjacent  South American continental margin.  Time averaged exhumation rates along  the Río Rincon anticline (54.6–22 Ma) and  along the Río Nutria thrust (46.5–22 Ma)  suggest rather low exhumation rates of 1.6–  1.2 mm/yr (maximum). The low exhumation  rates link back to constantly low subduction  rates resulting in a period of geological quiescence  between 46.5 and 22 Ma.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Currently, this is a very lengthy and frustrating process. Concepts can be illustrated via sketches, but sketches are rarely enough to portray the exact vision of the author. Only the final rendering of the sketch into a realistic image (typically, via a labour-intensive manual process or costly computer graphics modeling) can convey the correct impression. Therefore, this creative process can become a slow, expensive, and tedious feedback cycle. Fortunately, nowadays we have access to a vast array of real images, and it is plausible to think that some of these images contain parts that can be efficiently used to build a realistic rendering of a sketch. Indeed, there exists recent work that exploits this idea by retrieving, cutting, and pasting objects from real images to then compose a convincing result. These methods rely on finding image content that can be used ``as is'' in the final rendering. However, this assumption is quite debatable, even with current large data collections, because of the high dimensionality of the space of all possible views, deformations, and illuminations of each object instance. One can instead more conceivably find a close match of just one aspect of the sketch, i.e., either the specific object instance (e.g., a smiling face), or the specific viewpoint, or the specific illumination. Unluckily, as of now, there does not exist a system that can accurately modify the content found in real images both geometrically and photometrically to match a sketch.We propose to develop novel solutions for generating realistic images from sketches. We envision an interactive system that finds and carefully matches image content to a sketch, by using a combination of geometric and photometric deformations that are low-order globally and piecewise smooth locally. Moreover, to limit the magnitude of the geometric deformations, our solution exploits a hierarchical matching of sketch parts at different scales. Our assumption is that content in real images can be matched closely to the sketch at some scale. For example, it might not be possible to find a real image of a specific viewpoint of a smiling face, but it might be more likely to find real images of a specific viewpoint of parts of the face, e.g., the nose, the eyes, the mouth and so on. Because we strongly rely on the input sketch, we also introduce an important novel step in its analysis. To assist the author with creating an accurate sketch, our proposed system will automatically detect symmetries, repeating patterns, and perspective effects, and allow the user to amend the sketch by enforcing exact regularity of these properties. Moreover, the system will use these properties in the matching to real images to determine viewpoints, textural patterns and dealing with occlusions.",Institut für Informatik Universität Bern,Bern,607653,0000-0003-3546-8247,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In detail, we will develop a method to automatically generate system test cases, targeting the problem of testing the common class of software systems that elaborate complex input data characterised by different kinds of mutually dependent values, and we will define approaches and techniques to automatically generate complex sequences of mutually dependent and realistic data that will extensively sample the behavior of the system under test. System testing is inherently different from unit and integration testing due to the nature, dimension and articulation of the execution space.  The nature of the execution space is different because system testing targets the behavior of the system as a whole, for example, sorting a list of contacts, while unit and integration testing targets the behavior of units and their interactions independently for the overall execution context, for example, sorting strings.  Thus, test case generation techniques that work at the system level shall generate semantically relevant input data, like realistic contacts and not just strings. The dimension of the execution space of a system may include a big variety of different data, while the execution space of single units and subsystems focuses on the much smaller subset of data relevant for the unit or the subsystem. Systematically exploring the execution space at the system level becomes prohibitive, thus defining effective heuristics for sampling the input space is extremely important to automate system testing.  The articulation of the execution space at system level differs from unit and integration level: while units and subsystems can be tested in isolation, system testing requires testing a system while interacting with the environment.  Thus system test cases must represent both meaningful sequences of operations and input data that represent appropriate interactions with the environment, that is, interaction sequences that lead to successful executions and data that refer to realistic and semantically coherent inputs.  So far, the research on automatic test case generation techniques has focused on unit and integration testing, paying less attention to system testing. The few approaches to system testing are based on models, learning techniques, search-based algorithms and reuse. These strategies do not tackle the problem of generating legal operation sequences and realistic and coherent test inputs, and can hardly cope with applications that extensively exploit the semantic of the input data. In this project we will define a new approach to automatically generate semantically coherent and effective system test suites for applications that require complex sequences of mutually dependent data.  The research will be grounded on our recent work and will (i) investigate the possibility of using both knowledge from a core set of correct executions and semantic information from system specifications to extend the ability of machine learning techniques, and in particular Q-learning, to deal with complex  sequences of operation, (ii) study the integration of different knowledge bases, starting with the Web of data, to address specific application domains, (iii) define techniques that support an efficient interplay between the different approaches by exploring complementarities and similarities, (iv) define techniques to deal with semantic correlations between data used in different operations, (v) define approaches to efficiently deal with negative cases, (vi) complement the approaches with techniques to automatically generate partial oracles, and (vii) experimentally evaluate the approach with suitable prototypes referring to applications from different domains and based on different technologies.",Istituto del Software (SI) Facoltà di scienze informatiche,Lugano,533605,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",Italy,Peer-reviewed,Contribution to book (peer-reviewed),Recent Advances in Automatic Black-Box Testing,"Mariani Leonardo,  Pezzè Mauro,  Zuddas Daniele",Published,2015,652458,,http://star.inf.usi.ch/star/publications.php,Advances in Computers,"Elsevier,Berlin",Advances in Computers,,,157,193,Advances in Computers,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The vast literature on the subject is evidence of the relevance of this problem [5]. In the last decade our group has been actively involved in developing methods that speed up sampling and calculate rates of transition between metastable states separated by large barriers. In particular we have introduced a method called Metadynamics [6, 7] and more recently a variationally enhanced sampling [8] (VES) approach that have proven to be extremely effective. When properly engineered both methods allow also the calculation of rates [9,10]. Thus far this effort has been mostly focused on classical systems. One of the aims of this project is to extend these sampling methods to quantum systems and calculate quantum rates. We shall use the Feynman’s Path Integral formulation [11, 12] of quantum statistical systems to map the quantum system into an isomorphic classical system. Neglecting quantum exchanges, each particle is mapped into a ring polymer of P beads. As P ? 8 the exact quantum limit is reached while the P = 1 case corresponds to the purely classical case [13, 14]. While in principle a quantum system is expected to surmount high barriers thanks to effects like zero point motion and tunneling, still in the presence of high barriers sampling remains severely hindered [15]. The few methods that have been proposed [16-22] for quantum systems presume conditions and or knowledge of the system that in complex situations are not available. Here we propose to develop a number of specifically designed methods to sample quantum systems that can be applied blindly to very generic systems. In preliminary investigations [15, 23] we have shown that this is possible. On the one hand we have been able to enhance sampling in quantum systems on the other we have shown that sampling quantum systems can be profitably used to sample classical systems. We plan to extend this approach in various directions including the introduction of Bose exchange processes [24]. The resulting software will be made available to the community. We want also to calculate rates for quantum transitions. We will follow two approaches: the first one at variance with previous efforts [25, 26] does not contain any approximation, the second one will be more approximated but computationally more expedite and capable of overcoming barriers where other methods fail.The project duration is scheduled for 3 years and it will involve one post-doctoral researcher and a doctoral student with a total working load of 180%.[1] R.

It is a major cause of primary hip osteoarthritis and one of the key risk factors that may lead to early cartilage and labral damage in young adults. The therapy of FAI involves the surgical resection of the impinging areas of the acetabulum and the proximal femur. Based on a strong research experience on FAI, we know that its diagnosis is difficult and that the current gold standard is problematic as it requires the direct intraoperative visualization of the impingement conflict. A less invasive approach relies on a radiological analysis of standard 2D radiographs and MR images - a task however not automated and whose quality depends on the physician’s expertise. Virtual 3D impingement simulations provide a more objective and accurate way to study FAI but most approaches rely on CT scans, which expose patients to high doses of radiation. MR images were used as a non-invasive alternative to build 3D models for FAI analysis but the resulting approaches were often not fully automatic or required conditions sometimes incompatible with clinical setups (e.g., MR images with large field-of-view (FOV))Contents and Objectives of the Research Project.This project will develop an efficient method to generate 3D anatomical models using Computed Tomography (CT)-free imaging protocols that are used in clinical routine in order to support computer-assisted diagnosis and surgical planning of FAI. We will devise a fully automatic approach based on multi-modal images combining 2D X-ray radiograph with 3D Magnetic Resonance (MR) Images acquired with small FOV. In order to achieve this goal, we are aiming to develop A) a fully automatic, machine learning based approach for segmenting 3D MRI data acquired with small FOV; B) a disease-specific, articulated statistical shape model (DS-aSSM) based 2D-3D reconstruction technique to generate 3D patient-specific models from 2D X-rays; and C) a robust multi-modal data fusion method to fuse models generated from A) and B).Scientific and Social Impact of the Research ProjectAlthough there are many risk factors contributing to hip osteoarthritis (HOA), it is now generally accepted that more subtle bony abnormalities associated with FAI and/or developmental dysplasia (DD) contribute substantially to HOA.  Various studies have suggested that computer-assisted 3D modeling techniques can help clinicians to better understand the dynamic and static factors of FAI - via patient-specific pre-operative planning and intra-operative assessment. Capitalizing on standard FAI diagnosis imaging protocol, i.e., conventional X-rays and MRI, to reduce radiation and to avoid unnecessary disruption to the standard clinical workflow, the proposed CT-free 3D anatomical model generation approach will facilitate a future wide-spread access of computational simulation and virtual surgical planning techniques for patients with FAI and address a key social challenge of our society.",Département de médecine Faculté des sciences Université de Fribourg,Fribourg,510900,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results",China,Peer-reviewed,Contribution to book (peer-reviewed),Latent3DU-net: Multi-level Latent Shape Space Constrained 3D U-net for Automatic Segmentation of the Proximal Femur from Radial MRI of the Hip,"ZengGuodong,  QianWang,  LerchTill,  SchmaranzerFlorian,  TannastMoritz,  SiebenrockKlaus,  ZhengGuoyan",Published,2018,978-3-030-00918-2,10.1007/978-3-030-00919-9,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-00919-9_22,International Workshop on Machine Learning in Medical Imaging,"Springer,Cham",International Workshop on Machine Learning in Medical Imaging,,,188,196,International Workshop on Machine Learning in Medical Imaging,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The combination of the eccentricity of Earth's orbit as well as the precession and obliquity of its spin axis produce cyclic changes in the insolation curve at a given spot on Earth, known as Milankovic cycles (Milankovic, 1941), and are the major driver of the cyclic changes of our climate. These cycles can be reconstructed back in time from bedded sedimentary deposits that record the orbital parameters through strongly climate-dependent input into a sedimentary basin. A second type of interaction between the solar system and processes on Earth is caused by the Earth-Moon tidal friction (transfer of energy and angular momentum of Earth's rotation to Moon's orbital motion), which is slowing down Earth's rotation as well as causing the recession of the Moon from the Earth. These interactions are recorded in the sedimentary record by rhythmically layered tidalites in delta settings, where they represent semi-diurnal or diurnal tidal cycles. Very astonishingly (and fortuitous for us), some of these cyclic and rhythmic sedimentary features are still preserved in Paleo- to Neoprotoerozoic sedimentary rocks and can be counted in order to determine the length of days, months and years in the deep geological past (Williams, 2000). This project plans to make a novel contribution to the knowledge of the orbital parameters of our solar system in the Proterozoic by direct dating of volcanic ash beds occurring as layers in rhythmic and cyclic sedimentary rocks, by applying high-precision U-Pb dating techniques using the mineral zircon. Combining these highly precise U-Pb dates and sophisticated Bayesian depositional rate models with orbital tuning (recognition of orbitally forced sedimentary cycles) in chemical and clastic depositional environments, we will determine the length of sedimentary cycles, assign them to orbital parameters (eccentricity, obliquity, precession) and directly determine their durations. We have identified undisturbed and spectacularly well-preserved Proterozoic sedimentary sequences in Western Australia (Hamersley basin), in the Northwestern Territories in Canada (Slave province), and in Eastern Brazil (Diamantina basin). Our precise age determinations on zircon in interbedded ash layers will be used to establish age models based on Bayesian probabilistic statistics (Parnell et al., 2008) and calculate durations of presumed orbital cycles. The data will finally be integrated in numerical models of orbital mechanics of early solar system.In conclusion, the project will potentially create the following new knowledge:•Establish quantitative age models through high-precision U-Pb and probabilistic age modelling for Paleo- and Mesoproterozoic sedimentary sequences on three continents and demonstrate that they are orbitally forced.•Calculate the durations of these cycles and compare them to modern astronomical solutions (Laskar et al. 2011).•Calculate orbital parameters for the solar system 2.5, 1.9 and 1.4 Ga ago.

We actively take part in developing a newly emerged  area called Complex Elliptic Geometry.This area is investigating flexibility properties in Complex Analytic Geometry. One of it's central  notions the notion  of an Oka manifold has recently been  introduced by Forstneric. Maps from Stein spaces into Oka manifolds are very flexible by the Oka-Grauert-Gromov-h-principle.We work both on a general theory by studying their properties under natural operations  and on finding good examples of such manifolds. Most importantly we work on applications of the theory to very natural problems.Here we do both investigate problems using fixed coordinate systems andproblems where the right choice of coordinates is the mainproblem. The approach to that second sort of problems is by studyingthe symmetry group leaving the given structure invariant. Thesetransformation groups play a fundamental role in many mathematicaltheories. Quite often they help to discover new interestingphenomena. An example for that is the following very ambitious question: Can onecharacterize affine n-space among all Stein manifolds of dimension n bygeometric data and data on the group of holomorphic automorphisms?The study of transformation groups of a space has intrinsic relationsto the question of how the space or other spaces (playing the role offixed points or more generally Luna strata) can beembedded into euclidean space.

Let G be a reductive complex Lie group acting holomorphically on normal Stein spaces X and Y which are locally G biholomorphic over a common categorical quotient Q. When is there a global G biholomorphism X → Y? If the actions of G on X and Y are what we with justification call generic we prove that the obstruction to solving this local to global problem is topological and provide sufficient conditions for it to vanish. Our main tool is the equivariant version of Grauert's Oka principle due to Heinzner and Kutzschebauch. We prove that X and Y are G biholomorphic if X is K contractible where K is a maximal compact subgroup of G or if X and Y are smooth and there is a G diffeomorphism ψ : X → Y over Q which is holomorphic when restricted to each fibre of the quotient map X → Q. We prove a similar theorem when ψ is only a G homeomorphism but with an assumption about its action on G finite functions. When G is abelian we obtain stronger theorems. Our results can be interpreted as instances of the Oka principle for sections of the sheaf of G biholomorphisms from X to Y over Q. This sheaf can be badly singular even for a low dimensional representation of SL < inf > 2 < /inf > (C). Our work is in part motivated by the linearisation problem for actions on C < sup > n < /sup > . It follows from one of our main results that a holomorphic G action on C < sup > n < /sup >  which is locally G biholomorphic over a common quotient to a generic linear action is linearisable.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Over the last few years the use of big data has gradually established itself as a strategic resource for drug discovery. One aspect concerns the use of very large compound databases to open new opportunities for discovery. The unique contribution of my research group has been the production of the Chemical Universe Databases GDB-11, GDB-13 and GDB-17, which enumerate all possible organic molecules up to 11, 13 and 17 atoms following simple rules for synthetic feasibility and chemical stability, but taking the complete range of possible scaffold topologies into account. With 166.4 billion structures, GDB-17 is the largest small molecule database available today. Due to its size essentially all of its content represents new molecules. This proposal aims at further developing methods to exploit this unique resource for drug discovery, and at extending the database to larger molecules.   Project A: The fragment database GDB-17F. A fragment subset of GDB-17, named GDB-17F and containing 4.6 billion structures, has been produced by selecting molecules with reduced complexity and complying with the rules of fragments by imposing constraints on the number of asymmetric and quaternary centers, molecule polarity and flexibility. An ongoing project to discover biologically active fragments by coupling virtual screening with organic synthesis and assays will be pursued. Project B: Adrenergic ligands from GDB-17. A virtual screening workflow has been established to identify analogs of any query molecule by a sequence of fingerprint similarity searches in GDB-17. In collaboration with Prof. P. Kolb in Marburg, we have performed high-throughput docking on a limited set of 360,000 structures identified by a search of the entire 166.4 billion molecules in GDB-17 for new analogs of ß-adrenergic receptor ligands. The workflow is entirely innovative and comprises visual selection from interactive color-coded maps of the database in pharmacophore fingerprint space. A series of new ligands will be synthesized and tested to identify new modulators of the ß-adrenergic receptor, providing an important proof-of-concept for the exploitation of GDB-17 in drug discovery. Project C: Expanding the GDB. In this project we will continue our effort to expand GDB to larger molecules by completing the assembly of GDB-30, which is an interactive resource to explore organic molecules up to 30 atoms based on a graph classification. The underlying data is a database of 55 billion graphs which can be searched by topological shape similarity. A molecule enumerator is connected to this database such that shape/pharmacophore analogs of any query molecule are generated covering a broad range of scaffold topologies.

Since an essential element of such UGC is information with a geographic connotation - ranging from volunteered geodata on OpenStreetMap.org, to georeferenced and tagged pictures on Flickr.com, and to location check-in on social media sites such as Foursquare, Facebook and Twitter - research has developed a variety of techniques to extract information about places, and thus place descriptions, the descriptions of places provided by everyday people. For instance, the characteristics of certain places, the activities and services they afford, a qualification of these services, and other information that is relevant to specific user groups.As a further trend, maps have increasingly become adaptive. Adaptation to users and their context of use is an indispen-sable element of modern web and mobile information systems, in particular location-based services (LBS) and social media applications. This has fostered the development of methods for providing information about the importance of places (relevance ranking, recommender systems) as a basis for adaptation, as well as techniques for adaptive map generalization, allowing adaptation of content in the visual portrayal of maps.However, these two streams of research have largely evolved in separation from each other. Place descriptions have hardly been used in map visualizations; and conversely, adaptive map portrayal in LBS and similar systems has been restricted to the use of static information (e.g. existing attributes of points-of-interest, links to related web pages). Methods that harness the potential of UGC-extracted place descriptions in map visualization are missing and current generalization methods still typically lack methods which specifically account for place.The overall objective of the proposed project is thus to develop methods to make map generalization operations adap-tive to the peculiarities of particular places extracted from UGC, and thus achieve a new form of map: place-based maps. A place-based map can be understood as a summarizing, integrated ‘graphic image’ in the Bertinian sense (Ber-tin, 1983) of the affordances and themes in a particular locale that a community of users is interested in. We will realize such maps by linking place descriptions extracted from UGC and unstructured text to drive adaptive generalization, thus achieving place-based generalization in the portrayal of maps.In order to achieve this objective, the proposed project seeks to capitalize on the results of previous research by both applicants , in two subprojects, each of which represents a particular stream of research in the applicants’ groups.Subproject A will focus on the generation of place descriptions using UGC and unstructured text. These descriptions will address all three aspects of place as defined by Agnew (2012): location (placenames and associated regions), locale (the environment and associated affordances within such a region) and sense of place (the experiences offered by a place to a group and the shared conceptualization of a place important to that group). Place descriptions will take two forms - population of a schema designed directly to drive the generalization process with traditional geometric data, and richer, more textually based descriptions, requiring more novel methods of incorporation into place-based maps. Subproject B will take the triad of place description information extracted in Subproject A and develop processes that allow controlling the automated generalization operations such that place-based maps can be obtained. Work planned in this subproject will start with a design of the components of place-based map generalization (data types, data flows, generalization operators, and map designs). Procedures will be developed that allow integrating the geometries, seman-tics, and textual descriptions of place descriptions into a form that can be usefully displayed on a map. Specialized gen-eralization operators will be developed that can exploit place descriptions, with a focus on abstraction and schematiza-tion. And finally, coherent processes of place-based generalization will be built from these operators.",Geographic Information Science (GIS) Geographisches Institut Universität Zürich - Irchel,Zürich,17898,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Peer-reviewed,Contribution to book (peer-reviewed),A methodological toolbox for exploring collections of textually annotated georeferenced photographs,"Purves Ross S.,  Mackaness William A.",Published,2016,978-1-909188-79-2,10.5334/bax,http://www.ubiquitypress.com/site/books/10.5334/bax/,European Handbook of Crowdsourced Geographic Information,"Ubiquity Press,London",European Handbook of Crowdsourced Geographic Information,,,145,156,European Handbook of Crowdsourced Geographic Information,,This chapter provides a brief overview of some methodologies used to extract meaning from the analysis of geotagged images.

Examples are the detection of the fractal behaviour in the spectrum of Landau levels [1-3], an even-denominator fractional quantum Hall state in bilayer graphene [4], and the identification of the nature of broken symmetry states due to electron-electron interactions [5-8]. What is enabling these results is the impressive progress in device fabrication, which is unfolding in two main directions: the realization of structures to minimize disorder [9, 10], and the development of new graphene-based interfaces and hetero-structures [11, 12]. This work represents the frontier of fundamental investigations in graphene electronics, and is disclosing new research domains, such as the study of how interfacial interactions can be used to engineer the electronic properties of graphene.In this context, I propose to investigate transport through different kinds of advanced graphene nano-structures, which will enable us to pursue a number of specific objectives. We will study multi-terminal suspended graphene structures, with a level of disorder smaller than in any other device type. For technical reasons, the near totality of past transport experiments in suspended devices was done in a two-terminal configuration, which severely limits the possible measurements. Recently, we have developed a process to realize high-quality multi-terminal devices, applied it to bilayer graphene [13], and discovered an even-denominator fractional quantum Hall state at filling factor ?=-1/2 [4]. We propose to apply the technique to investigate systematically devices based on layers of different thickness (mono-, bi-, tri-layers, etc.). As in the case of bilayers, multi-terminal measurements at such a low disorder level are likely to detect new phenomena. By optimizing the fabrication technique we will increase the yield of working devices, which will allow us to realize more sophisticated multi-terminal structures. These will include double-gated four-terminal bilayers -to probe transport in the presence of an induced gap in the “bulk” and the existence of in-gap edge states [14, 15]- as well as devices with more than four terminals -to explore non-local transport [16] and phenomena such as the valley Hall effect [17].In parallel, we will investigate transport through graphene on transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) substrates [18], such as WS2, MoS2 [19], WSe2, and MoSe2. These layered materials have very flat surfaces, a hexagonal crystal lattice (like graphene), and appear to be ideal substrates for graphene [20]. They have a very large spin orbit interaction (SOI), ranging from tens of meV in the conduction band, to ~400 meV at the top of the valence band (depending on the compound) [21, 22]. By using these substrates, we aim at inducing SOI in graphene and control its magnitude. Very recent measurements on graphene-on-WS2 done in our laboratory show pronounced weak anti-localization at low temperature, demonstrating that SOI is indeed induced. Our work will aim at determining the strength of the SOI, how it depends on the position of the Fermi level in graphene relative to the TMD bands, and on the specific TMD material used. We also aim at clarifying the nature of the electronic interaction occurring at the graphene/TMD interface. A key point is that in the presence of SOI, graphene should exhibit the topological insulating behaviour predicted by Kane and Mele [23], which will become experimentally accessible for sufficiently large SOI strength. We will strive to reach this regime, and we will search to detect the edge transport that is the distinctive signature of the Kane&Mele state. Finally, we will also realize devices based on graphene encapsulated in boron nitride [24, 25]. A specific goal is the realization of topological one-dimensional channels in bilayers, by using split-double gates, which allow a gap with opposite sign to be opened on opposite side of the channel [14]. Such channels -which would lead to distinctive transport signatures- are particularly interesting because they would demonstrate the ability to control the topological state of the device acting on the gate voltage.",Département de Physique de la Matière Quantique (DQMP) Université de Genève,Genève 4,545534,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",Spain,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),Controlling the topological sector of magnetic solitons in exfoliated Cr1/3NbS2 crystals,"Wang Lin,  Chepiga Natalia,  Ki DongKeun,  Li L.,  Li F.,  Zhu W.,  Kato Y.,  Ovchinnikova Olga S.,  Mila F.,  Martin I.,  Mandrus D.,  Morpurgo Alberto F.",Accepted,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.02773.pdf,Physical Review Letters,,Physical Review Letters,118,,257203,,Physical Review Letters,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In a similar direction, the full Bott-Samelson theorem on the topology of manifolds all of whose geodesics are closed holds on spherizations for which there is a fiber sphere that can be moved to itself by a positive contact isotopy.2. Positive topological entropy of all Reeb flows on a given contact manifold isknown only for the very special class of spherizationsand for a few contact 3-manifolds.This project of M.

We show that: if for a pair of Legendrian knots in a contact 3 manifold (Formula presented.) the strip Legendrian contact homology is defined and has exponential homotopical growth with respect to the action then every Reeb flow on (Formula presented.) has positive topological entropy. This has the following dynamical consequence: for all Reeb flows (even degenerate ones) on (Formula presented.) the number of hyperbolic periodic orbits grows exponentially with respect to the period.

Exploring new methods for the transfer of such films to other substrates we propose to build stacks of such materials with defined relative crystal orientation. Monolayers of magnetic rare-earth nitride endofullerenes on h-BN/Ni(111) will be studied in terms of orientational order of the carbon cage and the endohedral unit on the one hand, and the magnetic order on the other hand, addressing issues of magnetic anisotropy. Finally, we take advantage of our recent discovery that noble gas atoms can be brought between a h-BN sheet and the Rh(111) surface by low-energy ion implantation, where they are immobilized at specific sites within the superstructure unit cell. This is used as the starting point for further investigations involving ion implantation of different atomic species, in view of promoting chemistry across an inert single-layer membrane.B) Electron dynamics in single-layer materials - valleytronics:We propose an investigation of the intrinsic timescales of scattering and exciton lifetimes in materials suitable for valleytronic devices. Such materials have a specific band structure with several inequivalent conduction band minima, termed valleys. The h-BN single layer on Ni(111) has this property and will be the first system to be studied. It will be followed by single layers of transition metal dichalcogenides like MoS2 and WSe2, for which CVD growth recipes will be implemented.

Not only do these systems present a fascinating type of nonequilibrium fluid, exhibiting novel dynamics and phase behavior, they are also relevant for understanding the dynamics of biological systems. Of particular practical relevance are suspensions of \textit{anisotropic} Brownian particles, as these most closely represent the generic type of particles one encounters in nature. However, despite the strong research drive to understand active systems, there remains a clear need for a fundamental theoretical understanding of even the basic principles underlying the dynamics. The aim of this proposal is to exploit and extend recent developments in the theory of active particle dynamics and density functional theory to investigate, on a microscopic level, the dynamics and phase behavior of anisotropic Brownian particles. In recent work by the applicants, it has been shown that for spherically symmetric active particles, the nonequilibrium system can be usefully mapped onto an \textit{effective} equilibrium system, in which the particles interact via an effective potential. This approach can describe quantitatively several of the structural changes (as encoded by spatial correlation functions) seen in computer simulations and captures the phenomenon of mobility-induced phase separation. Moreover, in the presence of a substrate we have predicted collective interfacial phenomena, such as activity-induced wetting and capillary condensation. The effective equilibrium mapping has thus attracted much attention within the community of researchers working on active particles.  We plan to extend and develop these methods to investigate from first principles the collective behavior of anisotropic active Brownian particles within an effective equilibrium picture. Our research plan will be facilitated by our experience with spherically symmetric active particles and with equilibrium theories of Liquid Crystals, in particular density functional theory. With these tools we will develop a dynamic density functional theory approach, which will enable us to investigate the influence of activity on the ordering, phase transitions and dynamics of anisotropic particles.

While nerve growth factors have been thoroughly investigated in this context, these large proteins display limitations in clinical use. Therefore, small molecules inducing and promoting neuritogenesis could represent an interesting alternative. In this project, we propose to further develop our research program centered around neuritogenic natural products, with the specific aims of (1) obtain small molecule neurotrophins by total synthesis and generating function-optimized derivatives; (2) profile their mechanism of action; and (3) immobilize those compounds on surfaces to generate neuritogenic materials that could facilitate nerve regeneration. In order to address these research questions, we will utilize a multidisciplinary approach involving synthetic organic chemistry, chemical biology, and materials science. Over the last decade, our group has developed excellent competence in these different areas, as evidenced by high-profile publications. Collaborations with leading groups will further leverage our efforts. Concerning the first aim, we plan to develop a general route to the neuritogenic sesquiterpene majucin and its congeners. The proposed route involves key steps such as a radical cyclization, C-H activation and a novel KCN-mediated lactonization approach that should deliver the targets in a relatively short number of synthetic transformations. In a second line of investigation, we target perconianone and congeners by chemical synthesis following a postulated biogenetic route involving a late-stage aldol cyclization to furnish the hitherto unprecedented 6/6/6 carbocyclic sesquiterpene structure. The mechanism of action of these and several other neuritogenic natural products will be investigated in several collaborations using a series of complementary chemical biology approaches, such as HaploInsufficiency Profiling (HIP) and Homozygous deletion Profiling (HOP) assays in yeast, affinity based protein profiling, and endocannabinoid profiling, supported by the design and synthesis of probe compounds.  The ultimate aim is to generate neuritogenic surfaces for nerve regeneration based on small molecules. We plan to further develop our recently published catechol systems with regard to (1) profiling newly obtained compounds, (2) additional substrates such as metal oxides and polymeric substrates, and (3) dual mechanism of action systems involving microtubule stabilizing compounds.This project integrates our strong expertise in the synthesis and biological evaluation of natural products, and the design of bioactive materials and leverages these approaches by strong multidisciplinary collaborations to investigate neurite outgrowth, a fundamental process in neuroscience.",Department of Chemistry University of Zurich,Zürich,115370,0000-0003-3053-0689,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Exchange of personnel",Switzerland,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),Total Synthesis of the Polyoxygenated Sesquiterpenes Guignarderemophilanes C and D,"Ilazi Agron,  Liffert Raphael,  Gademann Karl",Published,2018,,10.1002/hlca.v101.4,https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/150839/,Helvetica Chimica Acta,,Helvetica Chimica Acta,101,4,e1800011,,Helvetica Chimica Acta,,The total syntheses of the neural anti‐inflammatory agents guignarderemophilanes C and D have been accomplished for the first time starting from γ‐hydroxy carvone in 15 and 14 steps respectively.

The aim of subproject A is to establish clear links between radiolarite distribution and changes in Mesozoic ocean circulation, palaeo-climate, and changes in the marine silica cycle. This part (PhD Maximilian Bôle) includes the following objectives: A1 Obtain precise accumulation rates of biogenic silica in typical Mesozoic-Early Tertiary palaeooceanographic settings of Tethys and Panthalassa and determining the origin of detrital material. A2 Control the relation between d30Si and palaeo-productivity in radiolarites using geochemical productivity proxies and control the impact of diagenesis on d30Si using d18O to finally reconstruct past marine silica cycle. A3 Control, if in addition to diagenesis, seawater temperature is effectively preserved in d18O of radiolarites and evaluate the role of climate on past silicon supply to oceans. A4 Evaluate the impact of the Pangea break-up on Mesozoic circulation and the marine silica cycle. The biosiliceous record and its variation in areal extension has not been integrated in Mesozoic climate reconstructions. In correlating the global Mesozoic biosiliceous record with refined global ocean current and climate models we hope to be able to quantify the Mesozoic marine silica cycle.Subproject B: Mesozoic Radiolarian biochronology and palaeo-biogeography. We propose to create a new, Late Cretaceous radiolarian biochronolgy based on Unitary Associations, a concept that has proven to be specially adapted to both temporally and spatially incomplete radiolarian fossil record. At present, we work with a database consisting of >12.000, mostly unpublished, SEM images from some hundred samples from low latitude DSDP/ODP Sites and land sections, covering the Late Cretaceous. Since occurrence and preservation is generally spotty at each site, few sections cover the entire time interval. Nevertheless, we can construct composite sections based on superpositional control provided by other fossil groups. We will also integrate published, stratigraphically and taxonomically reliable datasets. At first sight, the overall species diversity seems to be lower than for a similar Jurassic time interval, but many of the so far broadly described, long ranging species reveal significant morphologic variation through time. This variation has to be formally described and exploited for biochronology, if one wants to achieve a zonation with a better time resolution than the existing ones. As we did for the Jurassic-Early Cretaceous (Baumgartner et al., 1995), we want to use common, widely distributed morphotypes that can be recognised even in moderately preserved samples. This will allow a wide applicability of the zonation including samples from orogenic belts. Subprohect B includes the following objectives: B1. Obtain topotypic and stratigraphically calibrated material from DSDP-ODP and land sites/sections, where Late Cretaceous radiolarian taxa were described (Largely completed during earlier work). B2. Compare SEM and transmitted light illustrations of topotypic material with original descriptions. B3. Use morphometrics to try to separate closely related forms in well-preserved material. B4. Construct evolutionary lineages for selected taxa. B6. Define a new global Late Cretaceous radiolarian biozonation for low latitudes. The Creaton of a globally applicable, Late Cretaceous radiolatian biochronology in essential for a better understanding palaeogeography, orogenic and accretionary processes in many mountain chains of the world.

Hence they played an important role in the past and especially in the oceanic silicon cycle. During the Cainozoic they were supplanted by diatoms who dominant siliceous organisms since then. Previous studies have revealed that diatoms extract preferentially light  28Si over 30Si. This behaviour is similar to the preferential 12C extraction by photosynthetic organisms. The δ30Si is thus a potential proxy of paleoproductivity and especially of the siliceous paleoproductivity. The δ30Si composition of the diatom skeletons seems effectively to record their productivity and we wanted to check if this was also the case for past Mesozoic radiolarians. For this purpose we have checked the feasibility to measured in situ δ30Si and δ18O in radiolarites by SIMS and then the relevance of these measurements. As radiolarites are produced by diagenetic dissolution precipitation processes we firstly investigated the δ18O. We deciphered that the δ18O measured in radiolarites preserved an environmental component. This preservation is important because it indicates that the isotopic signatures were not overprinted by hydrothermal fluids. Then we investigated the preservation of the δ30Si in radiolarites. Convergent δ30Si results were observed through different sections indicating δ30Si variations are rather global than local. We compared our δ30Si with reference isotopic curves (δ18O δ13C and 87Sr/86Sr) and with estimations of silicon burial rates to determine the causes of these variations. These comparisons have confirmed that the oceanic silicon was in steady state in Mesozoic ocean. We observed low δ30Si associated with high silicon burial rate and high 87Sr/86Sr. This can be explained by fresh silicon supplied by rivers (low δ30Si and high 87Sr/86Sr). The riverine silicon inputs depend on climate but also on rocks exposed to weathering. On a section we observed covariations between δ30Si and trace elements supporting that low δ30Si are associated with high marine paleoproductivity. This is coherent with a scaling of productivity with nutrient supplied by rivers. During our studies we also  noticed that when the radiolarian productivity drops without scaling with river supply the δ30Si drops due to lower silicon extraction.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) constitute a versatile type of laser sources in the MIR and have been widely used for more than a decade in many sensing and spectroscopy applications. Distributed feedback (DFB) QCLs have been especially widely used as they offer attractive features like single-mode emission, high output power and continuous wavelength tunability. Their typical linewidth in the range of a few megahertz was generally fully appropriate for these applications. In the last years, there has been a growing interest for the development of MIR laser sources with a narrower linewidth for some emerging new applications, in particular in the field of frequency metrology. At the same time, there has been a growing interest for more thorough investigations of the noise properties of QCLs. We successively contributed to this field with our researches on the origin of noise and the development of noise reduction methods that were very fruitful in terms of scientific results and publications during the last years.Building upon this strong background and expertize, we want to pursue our effort to reduce noise in QCLs using various original approaches that make use of electrical or optical feedback. We will combine two technologies where Switzerland has been at the leading edge worldwide for many years, quantum cascade lasers and crystalline micro-resonators, in order to develop a compact narrow-linewidth MIR laser at 4.6 ?m by stabilizing a QCL onto the narrow resonance of a micro-resonator. We will also investigate novel schemes of noise reduction in QCLs that complement the previous techniques that we demonstrated in the recent years that do not need any optical reference, but instead exploit the electrical noise detected between the terminals of a QCL. In order to control the optical frequency of the QCL with this signal, we will investigate both self-optical control and novel QCL tuning mechanisms that have recently been reported.Optical frequency combs have recently been a breakthrough in frequency metrology by enabling a direct and coherent link between optical and radio-frequency spectral domains, but also for broadband high-resolution spectroscopy with unprecedented performance. MIR frequency combs are of particular interest for spectroscopy. Broadband QCLs have shown a few years ago to be able to generate a particular type of combs that is not associated to short pulses in the time domain, but with a frequency-modulated-like spectrum characterized by a nearly constant output power. The common self-referencing method used with frequency combs generated by modelocked lasers to detect their offset frequency is thus not applicable to such QCL-combs. Consequently, no noise characterization of the offset frequency of a QCL-comb has ever been performed so far. By combining a narrow linewidth QCL developed in this project with a novel method that we recently demonstrated to characterize the offset frequency in a frequency comb without self-referencing, we want to perform the first noise characterization of a QCL-comb. This work will provide important outcomes on the noise of these systems, which are promised to be a breakthrough in the development of compact spectrometers with unprecedented performance for broadband spectroscopy in the MIR molecular fingerprint region. This work will be realized in collaboration with the group of Prof. Jérôme Faist, who was the first to demonstrate these QCL combs. This work will make a direct link between the fields of spectroscopy and QCLs on one side and frequency metrology (frequency combs) on the other side, which merges two fields of expertize of the applicant and of the research team at UniNE-LTF that led to relevant research successes in the recent years.",Laboratoire Temps-Fréquence Université de Neuchâtel,Neuchâtel,564942,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication;Research Infrastructures",Switzerland,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,166104,Talks/events/exhibitions,"Festisciences, portes ouvertes Faculté des Sciences",http://www.unine.ch/festisciences,2016

The objective of the proposed research is thus to develop useful tools for selective transformations or reactions using (i) cationic reagents, chromophores and catalysts of original structure and (ii) novel ylide chemistry. A particular emphasis will be given to stereoselective processes.As a matter of fact, the association of prochiral or chiral ionic species with enantiopure counterions results in the formation of diastereomeric salts. In tightly associated ion pairs, large chemical and physical differences can then happen favoring the selective formation of one of the diastereomeric salt. High level of asymmetric recognition can then be achieved leading to efficient processes of asymmetric detection, resolution, induction and synthesis. Good stereoselectivity can be obtained during reactions.Importantly, intramolecular charged-separated situations benefit also from the enhanced reactivity that comes from the presence of positive or negative charges on substrates and reagents. In fact, chemists rely strongly on ylides and 1,3-dipoles to promote bond forming reactions; these species undergoing many spontaneous (asymmetric) transformations of synthetic utility. This chemistry is also amenable to metal-catalysis that provides the means to control reactivity and stereochemistry, and tools to understand the intricate details of reactions.In the next two years, our program on the synthesis and the use of chiral cations will be again strengthened. We will use the knowledge gained in our group to develop novel functionalized cationic triangulenes, [4], [5], [6] and higher order helicenes. The synthesis and resolution of the novel chiral derivatives will be studied and a particular emphasis will be given to the development of selective post-functionalization protocols to modulate and fine tune both steric and electronic properties. Care will be taken to use these derivatives in enantioselective phase transfer catalysis. The photochemical and photophysical properties will be also strongly studied as these compounds are effective dyes and fluorophores up to the near IR region. During this funding period, we will apply the practical and theoretical knowledge gained in our group on reactions involving oxonium and ammonium ylide intermediates. We will use our expertise in [1,2]-Stevens rearrangements to perform enantiospecific transformation of chiral amines. We will develop oxonium-ylide-based cyclizations to transform simple and functionalized cyclic ethers into a variety of original polyether derivatives; some of which being easily transformed into novel (chiral) crown-ethers. We will also highlight the importance of the metal catalysis as dirhodium and CpRu complexes afforded dichotomous pathways.This proposal thus outlines a research plan aimed at the preparation of chiral salts and ylides, and their use in synthetic (asymmetric) chemistry in a broad sense.",Département de Chimie Organique Université de Genève,Genève 4,62800,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the Swiss landscape, the study of star formation and related topics has started relatively recently in Geneva and more so in Zurich, with new groups working on observations and simulations from the Milky Way to the distant Universe. Although each group is among the world leaders in their speciality, the groups are small, competition is fierce at the international level, and Switzerland is not enough prepared to exploit at an appropriate level the new IR and millimeter facilities, and to take a lead in large international collaborations in this domain.To remedy this situation we have recently initiated the STARFORM network to (1) bring together for the first time the various groups working on star formation and related aspects in Switzerland, (2) train PhD students and young researchers in this field, and (3) address some of the fundamental questions on star formation in a new approach combining multi-wavelength observations, theory, and state-of-the-art numerical simulations. After a successful initial phase of STARFORM, providing funding for PhD students and post-docs for two years which will end in October 2015, we here request a prolongation of the network for three additional years to reach new goals, achieve a high impact on our science topics, and to build a lasting network of collaborations for the future.Concretely we will, for example, carry out IR and millimeter observations of sites of star formation in the Milky Way, and study their properties, such as the core mass function, the kinematics and density structure of the cores. Multi-scale hydrodynamic simulations of cold gas clumps, molecular clouds, and entire galaxies will be undertaken. New treatments of radiation transfer, the chemistry of cold gas, and other improvements will be included in our simulations. A new tool to predict mock observations of molecular line and continuum properties from simulations will be developed. New IR/millimeter observations of strongly lensed, distant galaxies will be obtained to resolve their star-forming regions, and to determine their physical and dynamical properties in the early Universe.Among the main questions we will address are: Is there a unique law describing star formation across the Universe? What is the physics that controls the core mass spectrum, star formation efficiency, and duration of star formation in giant molecular clouds where most stars form? What is the importance of turbulence and cloud-cloud collisions in star formation? What is the physical origin and nature of star-forming clumps in high redshift galaxies? What is the nature and driver of star formation at high redshift (mergers, instabilities, cold gas accretion from the cosmic web)? How do high redshift galaxies evolve along the main sequence of star-forming galaxies and away from it, and what is the connection between structural evolution and evolution of the star formation rate?Our results should have important implications, not only for our understanding of star formation and related phenomena across the Universe, but also for many other domains of astrophysics, including the question and nature of dark matter, and cosmology. In particular, STARFORM will create a lasting expertise and community in IR/millimeter astronomy and on star formation. The new, common expertise and the newly developed tools to be developed within our project will give the groups and the Swiss community a competitive advantage.

Membrane proteins thereby function within the lipid membranes of cells, where they are responsible for a plethora of functions. Among others, they facilitate or regulate transport of molecules across the membrane, or sense ligands, membrane potential, or buffer gra-dients to react. Cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-EM) classically allows studying the high-resolution structure of membrane proteins, if these are lipid membrane-reconstituted and two-dimensionally crystallized. This method is called electron crystallography of membrane proteins. My group has developed an image processing package for the analysis of 2D crystals, called the 2dx software package. Cryo-EM of isolated single particles has seen a major breakthrough recently, through the introduction of di-rect electron detector (DED) cameras and the development of improved single particle image processing algorithms. Single-particle cryo-EM allows to rapidly determine the atomic resolution structure of detergent-solubilized membrane proteins without the need for crystallization. This, however, does not allow the direct study of the structure of membrane proteins in a full lipid membrane, as electron crystallography provides. In this project, we will extend the 2dx software suite to accelerate processing, to automate processing, to increase resolution of the 3D reconstructions, and to make this method largely independent of highly ordered 2D crystals, so that also membrane-reconstituted membrane proteins that are not - or only partly - in a crystalline arrangement can be studied at high resolution. This will be achieved by developing certain image processing algorithms and tools to apply iterative refine-ment procedures to 3D structure reconstructions, and by adopting some of the recent algorithmic develop-ments in the single particle field such as gold-standard FSC for reliable resolution estimation or drift-correction for dose-fractionation into the 2dx electron crystallography software suite. Finally, we will imple-ment an interface of the 2dx package to leading single particle software suites such as RELION and/or FREALIGN, and adapt the latter to the specific geometries and settings of cryo-EM data of membrane-embedded membrane proteins. For development purposes, a large high-resolution dataset of images of a potassium channel membrane protein system is available. These images are recorded of small 2D crystals that diffract only to about 12 Å resolution. Preliminary application of novel algorithms has already shown significant resolution improve-ments, so that the helical pitch of alpha helices and some side-chain densities are recognizable in the 3D reconstruction. This software will continue being available open-source under the GPL at 2dx.org, and we will organize regu-lar workshops for knowledge transfer and planning of further development targets.

When compared to other reaction categories such as cross-coupling, metathesis, or hydrogenations (reductions), oxidation chemistry is only poorly understood, and catalytically competent species are relatively rare. This under-development is in parts because of the reaction conditions that are often hostile to metal complexes (and labile ligands), in other parts due to the complexity of oxidative reactions, often requiring multistep proton and electron transfers to be managed.The proposed research addresses now challenging oxidation reactions by exploiting unique ligand properties that assist in enabling proton transfers in addition to electron transfers. The overarching concept is based on the use of ligands that are donor-flexible, that is, they are able to adapt their donor properties to the requirements of the metal center and are thus expected to lower the transition barriers of catalytic cycles. As donor-flexible ligands, we will explore in particular mesoionic C-donors (triazolylidenes, sometimes classified within ‘abnormal’ carbenes), and mesoionic N-donors (pyridinylidene amides and amines, PYAs and PYEs). These ligands have strongly diverging limiting resonance structures and can thus act as p-acidic or p-basic ligands to stabilize in a catalytic cycle low- and high-valent intermediates, respectively. In addition, we enhance the functionality of triazolylidenes by Lewis basic substituents that are unable to coordinate the metal center and hence serve as proton acceptor sites in (de)hydrogenation of substrates. Both classical ligand synthesis is proposed as well as an innovative new procedure for enhancing diversity and optimizing activity. Ultimately, this research project is aimed at converting substrates with high relevance for energy conversion, such as glycerol, lignin (biomass), as well as MeOH and H2O (for fuel cell applications and artificial photosynthesis, respectively). Moreover, routes are disclosed to expand this chemistry to Earth-abundant metals in an effort to develop more sustainable processes.","Departement für Chemie, Biochemie und Pharmazie Universität Bern",Bern,117439,0000-0001-7403-2329,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication;Research Infrastructures",United States of America,Peer-reviewed,,NHC-Based Iridium Catalysts for Hydrogenation and Dehydrogenation of N-Heteroarenes in Water under Mild Conditions,"Ángela Vivancos,  Beller Matthias,  Albrecht Martin",Published,2018,,10.1021/acscatal.7b03547,,{ACS} Catalysis,"American Chemical Society ({ACS}),",{ACS} Catalysis,,,17,21,{ACS} Catalysis,,,162868,Talks/events/exhibitions,Chemie & Energie: Katalyse-Forschung für die Nutzung nachhaltiger Energiequellen,http://www.dcb.unibe.ch/ueber_uns/aktuelles/veranstaltungen/biochemie_am_samstag_2015/index_ger.html,2016

The following problems/themes are of importance within the project:1) To use the language of derived geometry for better understanding of Lagrangian TQFTs.2) To develop the theory of higher associators and Grothendieck-Teichmüller groups, and to relate it to the LMO functor.3) To study uniqueness of Rouvière's e-function in the theory of symmetric spaces, and to obtain explicit formulas for the e-function in terms of Drinfeld associators.4) To construct quantum Poisson sigma models as fully extended TQFTs.5) To develop the theory of Wilson surfaces in 3D Chern-Simons theory and in the 4D topological Yang-Mills theory.These topics are rooted in my previous research on group valued moment maps and on the Kashiwara-Vergne Conjecture, and they develop it in various directions.

Merging of pre-existing clusters has been used to explain this.  We will show that there are some very simple constraints on this theory that have been neglected.  The dominant one is that if two clusters of comparable densities and very different masses merge, the large one 'owns' the center of mass.  Hence, the smaller population will be more extended.  This is contrary to what is seen, however large density contrasts could undo this.Project two:  we will unify several issues in the formation of galaxies and clusters of galaxies.  These are the transition from galaxies to clusters, the baryon fraction of galaxies (esp. in galaxies like the Milky Way where the black hole is a modest fraction of the mass) and the under abundance of even LMC size dwarfs in the field. Models of feedback have varying degrees of difficulty with these preheating looks like a likely solution.   Project three:  one of the most famous predictions of my group was that the central regions of dark matter should have a cuspy structure.  At the time, this was controversial and it took a long time to peel back the reasons that other simulators found cores.  Now, a consensus has developed that cusps can be transformed into cores by baryons, sometimes even when there aren't any.

We will study with unprecedenteddetail the early stages of the formation of very massive galaxies as well asof the progenitors of modern spiral galaxiesin order to provide the theoreticalground to interpret the growing body of observational dataon galaxies at $z \sim 5-10$.

This will shed new light on the validity of feedback modelsthat are normally tuned to reproduce only the mass and the structure of galaxies.Such a study will also address the long-standing 'missing baryons'problem, namely the fact that galaxies appear to have retained significantly lessthan their cosmic baryon budget. These challenging problems demand calculationsthat retain the information of the cosmological assembly and yet can resolvescales of tens to a few pc.We will use the new ChaNGa code  (http://www hpcc.astro.washington.edu/tools/changa.html) which used a 'modern'  pressure-energy formulation of SPH and a unique parallelization technique allowing it to scale to many thousand cores on the largestPetascale machines, such as the PizDaint supercomputer at the Swiss Supercomputing Center (CSCS).

It is estimated that about half of the received C returns to the atmosphere as gaseous methane or carbon dioxide. Substantial research is currently conducted to directly quantify the methane bubble emissions, however, little has been done to incorporate this C pathway into the individual aquatic and overall terrestrial C budgets. The stochastic nature of sediment-methane bubble release makes accurate quantification difficult, expensive and time-consuming. In fact, paleolimnogical studies quantifying organic C burial using sediment core archives do not consider historical C loss due to methane bubble release. Consequently, failure to account for the C loss due to methane bubbling in lakes can result in significant underestimation of the C turnover. The formation, growth and release of sediment-methane via bubbles affects the sediment biogeochemistry in two important ways. Firstly, as bubbles form and grow in the sediment, they will strip other dissolved gases from the porewater (i.e. conservative noble gases and dinitrogen). Once the bubbles are released, the mass of those stripped gases are also removed. Over time, this leads to a measurable depletion of these “passive” gases. Secondly, methanogens preferably utilize lighter carbon (C12 vs C13) in the production of methane. Therefore the formed methane bubbles remove lighter stable C isotopes, leaving a remaining heavier stable C isotope signature. I propose that knowledge of these depletion patterns can be exploited to (A) resolve the paleolimnological history of methane bubble release as it is related to historical eutrophication, and (B) quantify the current, system-integrated methane bubbling rates - the missing key to closing the C balance.  Noble gas porewater profiles and stable C isotopes will be resolved using combined, interdisciplinary, and readily-available state-of-the-art techniques, the results of which will then be integrated into system-analytical modeling approaches. With the outcome of this proposal, we will provide an invaluable suite of tools to estimate the historic and current sediment C remobilization and refine the C balance in inland waters. This work will be conducted at three selected Swiss lakes: (1) eutrophic (Soppensee), (2) eutrophic with an aeration-restoration measure in place (Lake Hallwil) and (3) oligotrophic (Lake Brienz).Specifically, this project addresses three major research questions:(1)Can bubble-facilitated porewater noble gas depletion and light C isotope depletion be used to predict present-day methane bubble fluxes?(2)Can bubble-facilitated porewater trace gas depletion and light C isotope depletion be used to reconstruct paleolimnological eutrophication and historic methane production?(3)Can the results from 1 & 2, combined with system analytic approaches, be used as a method to ‘plumb’ lake carbon balances and identify key eutrophication drivers?",Institut F.-A.

We experimentally measured the respiration rates of C. flavicans at different temperatures yielding a Q10 of 1.44–1.71 and a respiratory quotient of 0.84–0.98. Applying the experimental data in a system analytical approach we showed that migrating Chaoborus larvae can significantly add to the water column and sediment oxygen demand and contribute to the observed linear relationship between water column respiration and depth. The estimated phosphorus excretion by Chaoborus in sediment is comparable in magnitude to the required phosphorus loading for eutrophication. Migrating Chaoborus larvae thereby essentially trap nutrients between the water column and the sediment and this continuous internal loading of nutrients would delay lake remediation even when external inputs are stopped.,160018,"Media relations: print media, online media",Hallwilersee produziert so viel Methan wie 240 Kühe,,2017

In physics such a change of perspective can be given a precise meaning, in the form of a duality, a mathematical equivalence between two profoundly different theories.  In the research proposed here we will use holographic dualities, allowing us to change perspective from a gravitational description to a field-theory description, without any trace of gravity. In this way we will elucidate the physics of strongly correlated matter, particularly far from equilibrium, by studying the dual gravitational questions. Moreover, by applying the duality in the reverse direction, we propose to use insights and techniques gained in condensed matter theory and quantum information science to learn about gravity.To achieve these goals my group will develop and use highly innovative techniques, from numerical simulations in gravity to exact analytical calculations in quantum field theory. With the support of this FNS project grant, I propose to1. Extract universal properties of finite density strongly correlated matter, in particular far from equilibrium.My team and I will develop non-equilibrium steady-state thermodynamics by translating the physics of brane horizons. We will use numerical methods to study universal aspects of non-equilibrium dynamics of strongly coupled QFT with profound implications for both condensed matter and the quark-gluon plasma.

Knowledge of fluid/melt partition coefficients is thus essential to quantify the mass transfer of elements from magmas into diverse geological environments, including the subvolcanic realm where magmatic-hydrothermal ore deposits may form or into the atmosphere via quiet or violent volcanic degassing.This project proposes to quantify, in the subvolcanic magmatic environment, (i) element distribution coefficients between residual melt, minerals, and aqueous fluids for well over 25 elements, from Li to U, and (ii) Mo isotope fractionation between residual silicate melt, minerals and exsolving aqueous fluids. Focus is on the Torres del Paine igneous system that documents - at excellent outcrop conditions - diverse features of fluid saturation. These include pegmatoid to frothy zones and miarolitic cavities within the intrusive bodies that record hydrothermal processes from ~750 down to ~300 °C that appear not to have communicated with the rocks hosting the intrusions. Coexisting silicate melt and aqueous fluid inclusions, minerals and coexisting liquid-vapour fluid inclusions will be analyzed by detailed microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, LA-ICP-MS, EPMA, SIMS, and by liquid sample MC-ICP-MS techniques. The new partitioning data shall be interpreted in light of intensive parameters, e.g., fO2, fluid chlorinity at exsolution, concentration of other volatiles (F, S), and melt composition (e.g., aluminum saturation index, Cl/H2O concentration ratio) of which some have already been tightly constrained thanks to diverse research initiatives during the past years.Our recent finding of prominent Mo isotope fractionation during igneous differentiation up to and including fluid exsolution awaits confirmation by direct analysis of coexisting fluid and melt fractions (available in fluid and melt inclusions). Because fayalite is stable in the miarolitic cavities, fluid - ferrous silicate mineral d98Mo can also be quantified (note that common cavity minerals like quartz and feldspars do not host Mo).This project and future research initiatives in this direction are considered to be essential for our better understanding of how magmatic volatiles play their central role in the transport of chemical components between active magmatic systems and diverse geologic environments and, more specifically, what the decisive parameters are for the formation of magmatic-hydrothermal ore deposits.",Institut für Geologie Universität Bern,Bern,37786,0000-0002-5784-0639,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication;Research Infrastructures",Germany,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this project we will use advanced microscopy platforms to comprehensively characterize tendon cell response to mechanical stimuli presented by the extracellular tissue matrix.  The specific scientific aim is to delimit the ranges of mechanical stimuli that induce transient cell signaling (calcium as a secondary messenger), and to use the measurement of mechanically driven calcium flux to help isolate the cellular elements that detect mechanical stimuli.

They are used in various domains of mathematics: random matrices and ß-ensembles, Ewens model of random permutations, fractional quantum Hall states in theoretical physics or computation of multiple integrals involving Vandermonde determinants. These numerous applications have made Jack polynomials an important topic in algebraic combinatorics since the late eighties.Despite a rich literature, a number of important questions involving Jack polynomials are still unsolved. In particular, I would like to attack two long-standing conjectures: the b-conjecture of Goulden and Jackson, which relates Jack polynomials to a measure of non-orientability of surfaces with an embedded graph, and a positivity conjecture of Stanley on a deformation of the celebrated Littlewood-Richardson coefficients.A novelty of this project is the use of recent developments in the shifted symmetric function theory. In particular, the starting point of our approach is the following preliminary work: both conjectures have natural extensions in terms of structure constants of specific bases of the shifted symmetric function ring.Shifted symmetric functions should also be a valuable tool to study probabilistic models on partitions defined via Jack polynomials; this is illustrated in the Schur case by the famous result of Kerov, describing the fluctuations of random Young diagrams distributed with Plancherel measure around their limit shape. The second goal of this project is to explore such models in the Jack case. We will in particular be interested in the connections with the ß-ensembles from random matrix theory and the KPZ universality class.A common long term objective behind these questions is to find a hidden representation-theoretic or new combinatorial structure for Jack polynomials.

Such processes also may affect the troposphere and surface climate and vice versa. This interplay is governed by key parameters of the atmosphere, such as H2O, O3, temperature and wind. The proposed research activities are based on three pillars: •  excellent infrastructure for measuring key atmospheric constituents, •  expertise in data retrieval techniques and modeling and finally •  international cooperation and networking. During the last decade we have been successful in building up excellent infrastructure to measure the altitude distribution of water vapor, ozone, temperature and horizontal wind in the middle atmosphere, key elements of atmospheric and climate research. Wind measurements are a novelty as no other technique worldwide has been able to measure the wind speed on a regular basis in the middle atmosphere so far. Also temperature profiling in the stratosphere by ground based microwave radiometry is a novelty. The IAP at Bern acts as one of the primary stations of NDACC (Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Chang), and contributes to it with two microwave radiometers, one for ozone and the other one for water vapor. The ozone data series extends by now to more than two decades with an unprecedented time resolution of a few minutes. The possibility to study atmospheric phenomena at time scales from decades to minutes is exceptional. With the middle atmospheric water vapor radiometer we dispose over a most successful instrument that can retrieve H2O in the upper stratosphere and the mesosphere.

The project provides a novel, bottom-up approach to the identification of overlapping policy games and, more generally, to the analysis of political decision-making. While important theories regarding political decision-making and the policy process (Sabatier 1987; Baumgartner and Jones 1991; Adam and Kriesi 2007) have traditionally focused on single policy sectors, subsystems, or domains, recent research places an emphasis on linked subsystems or trans-subsystem dynamics (e.g. Hoberg and Morawski 2008; Jones and Jenkins-Smith 2009) and on collaborative governance (Ansell and Gash 2008). With the increasing complexity of modern political problems, actors are involved in an ecology of games (Dutton et al. 2012; Lubell et al. 2010) and simultaneously deal with several issues at different stages and levels, and across varying arenas. We argue that approaches focusing on single policy sectors, subsystems, or domains are unable to deal with this new complexity in political decision-making. They risk drawing an incomplete and potentially biased picture, and can lead to wrong inferences about the reasons for political outcomes. In the planned research project, we seek to overcome the limitations of these approaches by focusing explicitly on the games that actors play across issues, stages, levels and arenas. We ask, (1) how can overlapping games be identified; (2) what factors explain that actors or issues are involved in several games; and (3) how do the games that actors play interact with each other? To do so, we follow a strictly bottom-up, inductive research design. In a first step, we identify actors and issues related to water in the political, judicial, media, and scientific arenas. In a second step, the set of actors identified in step one is interviewed and new actors are added following the logic of snowball sampling. This data will allow us to reconstruct the games that actors play in a bottom-up way by employing new clique analysis methods adapted from social network analysis. Empirically, the research project deals with Swiss water politics. Water-related issues are often transboundary and cross-sectoral in nature and involve different levels of decision-making. This complexity makes water politics an ideal case in which to study overlapping games. Our analysis will lead us to (1) map Swiss water politics and its ecology of games; (2) explain the ecology of games by analyzing why actors or issues are involved in several games; and (3) contribute to theory by developing a typology of games.

Valuation; Choice Experiments,"Economic valuation deals with estimating the monetary values of non-market commodities, including benefits and costs associated with environmental improvement or its degradation. For this purpose, stated preference methods such as contingent valuation method (CVM) and stated choice experiments (CEs) are widely applied. They derive economic values based on individuals’ stated willingness to pay (WTP) for commodities like environmental goods or services. In recent years there is a clear trend of increased applications of the stated CEs at the expense of CVM mainly due to several important advantages of CEs over CVM (Hanley et al., 1998; Carlsson et al., 2007). Both methods elicit individuals’ preferences in a survey, thereby assuming that individuals are fully rational and hence know their preferences with certainty (Rabin, 1998; McFadden, 2001). Empirical insights, however, do not support this hypothesis as they reveal that respondents are often uncertain about their stated preferences (Ready et al., 1995; Champ et al., 1997; Alberini et al., 2003). They also show that preference uncertainty and the way this information is modeled can substantially influence WTP results. The underlying theoretical framework that explains what determines preference uncertainty of respondents does still not exist (Akter et al., 2009; Loomis, 2011). Moreover, the empirical evidence addressing the issue of preference uncertainty is much more abundant in CVM than in stated CE literature (Lundhede et al., 2009; Hensher et al., 2012).The principal objectives of the proposed research project are to (1) develop a novel theoretical framework that would explain the sources of preference uncertainty in stated CEs and (2) gather original empirical data about preference uncertainty through a survey to test and improve the theoretical framework. More specifically, the project will examine the role of policy outcome uncertainty, risk communication devices, the nature of the good being valued (public vs. private), and socio-cultural and institutional setting in explaining variations in preference uncertainty in stated CEs along with other relevant factors identified in the existing stated preference literature. It will also compare the performance of alternative formats for eliciting preference uncertainty from respondents and assess various econometric approaches for incorporating this information into choice models. The findings of this project will provide new insights into the most important drivers of preference uncertainty and offer an underlying theory that supports these findings. The outcomes are also expected to improve our understanding of the sources of hypothetical bias and yield new evidence about the validity of welfare measures obtained with the stated CE method.The application of the project involves conducting an online survey among the Swiss households in order to elicit their preferences and WTP for flood mitigation and adaptation policies to reduce future flood risk. This setting is considered suitable for testing the above-mentioned methodological aspects for several reasons: (1) floods represent the most important environmental risk in Switzerland (Swiss Re, 2012), (2) policy outcomes are highly uncertain due to varying degree of event probability, especially in the context of predicted climate change, and (3) mitigation and adaptation policies can be designed as expenditure for either private (flood insurance) or public (river restoration) goods. The influence of socio-cultural and institutional setting on preference uncertainty will be examined by carrying out the same survey among a smaller national household sample in the Netherlands. Being at the forefront of the flood risk management, this country represents an adequate complementary case study. In addition, the international partner in this project and his research group have an ample experience in flood risk management in the Netherlands.

To this end we combine  the results of a lottery game with the findings from a stated choice experiment  about flood risk reduction in Switzerland. We find that the  inclusion of probability weighting in particular can increase the explanatory  power of the choice model.

Hierbei handelt es sich um die gezielte Förderung der Siedlungsentwicklung nach innen, welche eine Notwendigkeit für die Erfüllung des Verfassungsauftrags eines haushälterischen Umgangs mit der nicht vermehrbaren Ressource Boden darstellt. Der gemeinnützige Wohnungsbau, dessen Angebot von rund 170'000 Wohnungen gut 4 Prozent des Gesamtbestandes in der Schweiz ausmacht, nimmt hinsichtlich der Innenentwicklung bereits heute eine Sonderrolle ein. Wichtige Aspekte sind (i) die Lage eines Grossteils des Siedlungsbestandes in den urbanen und suburbanen Gebieten (wo gemäss Raumkonzept Schweiz ein Grossteil des künftigen Bevölkerungs- und Arbeitsplatzwachstums in der Schweiz stattfinden soll), (ii) der deutlich unterdurchschnittliche Wohnflächenverbrauch pro Kopf in gemeinnützigen Wohnsiedlungen sowie (iii) die Impulswirkung in städtebaulich-ökologischer Hinsicht, welche besonders bei der Bautätigkeit gemeinnütziger Wohnbauträger in den letzten Jahren beobachtet werden konnte. Trotz (lokal begrenzten) Anzeichen einer Neube-lebung des gemeinnützigen Wohnungsbaus in der Schweiz, ist die Dynamik weiterhin gering. So stammt der Grossteil des heutigen gemeinnützigen Siedlungsbestandes aus der Zwischen- bzw. der Nachkriegszeit bis in die 1970er Jahre. Gerade diese Bestände, welche vielfach im Sinne der zu dieser Zeit oft propagierten Städtebautypologie der durchgrünten „Gartenstadt“ realisiert wurden, entsprechen hinsichtlich Ausbaustandard und Wohngrundrissen oft kaum mehr den heutigen Bedürfnissen der Mieterschaft. Gleichzeitig dürften sie ein erhebliches Potenzial zur baulichen Verdichtung aufweisen. Eine Übersicht zu den Quantitäten dieses Potenzials fehlt jedoch bis anhin. Diese soll im Rahmen des vorliegenden Vorhabens mittels einer umfassenden GIS-Analyse geschaffen und der untersuchte Siedlungsbestand im Hinblick auf die Eignung zur räumlichen Verdichtung beurteilt werden. Auf Grundlage der Diskussion konkreter Konzepte und Testentwürfe zur baulichen Weiterentwicklung von gemeinnützigen Wohnsiedlungen in zu bestimmenden Vertiefungsgebieten wird zudem versucht, Voraussetzungen für planerische Instrumente und Prozesse zu definieren, welche nicht nur die Mobilisierung der quantitativen Innenentwicklungspotenziale fördern, sondern bei allfälligen Verdichtungsmassnahmen im Bestand auch eine angemessene Siedlungsqualität sicherstellen.",Institut für Raum- u.

Between the countries big differences in market shares and support schemes for social housing exist. This paper investigates these characteristics of social housing in Europe as well as its trends in the recent years. The situation of social housing in Switzerland in the European context is highlighted – with a special focus to the aspect of inward urban development.  It is shown that market shares of social housing are generally declining in Europe. Parallely there has been a shift from bricks and mortar subsidies towards housing allowances and a focus on clearer targetting of the remaining social housing stock towards those most in need. While this can be seen as a necessity to reach a high effectiveness of social housing it has led to an increased concentration of economically and socially disadvantaged people in the remaining housing stock raising concerns about ghettoisation that contradict the housing paradigm of socially mixed neighbourhoods. In Switzerland social housing is partly clearly targeted at certain population parts (continously subsidized housing) but partly also open for all people (mostly social cooperative housing). This raises questions about the fair distribution of public housing subsidies but also reflects the large variety of different social housing providers in the country. Moreover – linking the subject of social housing and spatial planning – it is shown that social housing providers play an important role in the national spatial strategy of inward urban development. Using the example of the city of Zurich which has the biggest social housing market share (24 ) of any Swiss municipality success factors in this regard are examined. It is detected that a continous cooperation between the city authorities and social housing providers is a key factor for a succesful linkage of housing policies with urban development. The strategy builds upon a set of housing support measures from the city with clear requirements for compensatory measures by the social housing providers that further the quality and effectiveness of social housing projects.

The function of disgust as a pathogen avoidance promoter in the food domain is not well understood. One problem is that there is no food-specific disgust scale available that helps to measure individual differences in disgust sensitivity in the food domain. Thus, we developed a scale that measures different types of food disgust sensitivity. Our planned research in this proposal is based on this newly developed food disgust scale (F-DS). All activities outlined in the proposed Study 1 are dedicated to validating and comprehensively testing this new instrument. In addition to a mail survey, a physiological measure (pupil dilation) will be used for validation. Based on the new F-DS scale, the overarching aim of Study 2 is to find out whether the structure of food disgust applies cross-culturally. Furthermore, in this multi-country survey we will explore how food disgust is linked to popular constructs of food behaviour such as food neophobia. In Study 3, food disgust sensitivity and flavour preferences as well as responses to gustatory stimuli such as off-flavours in food will be examined to find out whether food disgust exerts an effect on a person’s sensory discriminant ability. Since new technologies such as genetically modified food are regarded as rather dreadful and unknown hazards, it is not surprising that many consumers are hesitant to accept GM food products. The focus in Study 4 is on new food technologies such as GM food and new food sources such as insects. A mail survey and experiments are proposed to uncover the association between food disgust sensitivity, moral concerns about food production and risk perception with regard to these foods. In addition, people low in food disgust sensitivity might be more likely to expose themselves to food risks. Thus, in Study 5 we will test this hypothesis by asking participants about hygienic aspects and risk perception with regard to food preparation and storage within the scope of a survey. Study 6 is based on three Internet experiments. We will explore whether food products based on gene technology are perceived as unnatural in food disgust sensitive people and to what extent these aspects lead to a biased perception and discount of GM benefits. The various studies will help not only to better understand how food disgust shapes people’s food behaviour in a functional and dysfunctional way, but they will also uncover factors that are important when it comes to consumer acceptance of new food sources and technologies.",Consumer Behavior Institute for Environmental Decisions IED ETH Zürich,Zürich,75144,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",Switzerland,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,165630,"Media relations: print media, online media","'Finden Sie das eklig?

At the same time, South Korean architects and landscape architects were seeking their inspiration in American and European design theories, techniques and style elements. In many cases historical knowledge of Korean architecture and garden art vanished, for instance Pungsu-jiri. Pungsu-jiri are teachings of the Korean geomancy, which determine the spatial arrangement, the orientation, and the use of specific places (e.g. buildings, parks or gravesites). Furthermore, the teachings demonstrate the relation between the topography, the orientation of the settlement and the personal welfare. They have not only influenced the urban areas and landscapes, but also the belief as well as the understanding of space and nature in Korea since the Choson dynasty (1392-1910). The dwindling of these traditional features has led to a critical debate about identity and culture in Korean architecture and landscape architecture. At the beginning of 21st century, numerous Korean politicians have increasingly promoted the return to Korean culture, history and nature. This paradigm shift was initiated by the urban policy of Seoul in the 1990s and has transformed the capital into a kind of laboratory since then.Hence, several landscape architecture projects were realized, which gave special consideration to traditional Korean design concepts and tried to link them to international design approaches. These projects have gained media and public attention, however the hidden structures and strategies behind these projects have not been academically examined. Therefore, the aim of this research project is to fill in this gap of knowledge. The doctoral thesis investigates this paradigm shift in Seoul. On the basis of this investigation, the thesis will suggest future strategies for countries in similar situations. The research project is based on the hypothesis that the investigation of Korean landscape architecture helps to develop strategies in order to transfer historical and cultural-specific design approaches into contemporary planning. Well-grounded investigations of historical and cultural layers as well as a precise analysis of culture-specific patterns could lead to a new design approaches and a better identification with the environment. Especially, since the knowledge and understanding of different cultural manifestations within design projects will become more important in light of globalization and increasing cultural exchange in the field of landscape architecture.",Institut für Raum- u.

Massenwohnungsbau im Wohlfahrtsstaat und in der Planwirtschaft in den 1960er- und 1970er-Jahren» wird das Phänomen des Massenwohnungsbaus anhand von drei Fallstudien in den USA, der Schweiz und der DDR untersucht. Ziel ist eine komparative und systemübergreifende Analyse der Verhältnisse zwischen den am Wohnungsbau beteiligten Akteuren, also den staatlichen und nichtstaatlichen Institutionen, den Architekten und Planern, den Bewohnern und Theoretikern. Die Aufarbeitung der bisher von der Forschung vernachlässigten experimentellen Ansätze trägt dazu bei, die Bauten und Diskurse dieser architekturgeschichtlich kurzen Phase und deren Nachwirken bis heute besser zu verstehen.Die Zeit der 1960er- und frühen 1970er-Jahre ist geprägt von Widersprüchen. Wirtschaftliches und demographisches Wachstum sowie technischer Fortschritt nährten einerseits den unerschütterlichen Glauben an die Planbarkeit von Umwelt und Gesellschaft und öffneten beidseits des Eisernen Vorhangs ein kurzes Zeitfenster für städtebauliche und wohnungspolitische Experimente. Andererseits spielten sich die soziokulturellen Umbrüche des Jahrzehnts vor dem Hintergrund einer permanenten Gewaltkulisse ab, die durch Ereignisse wie dem Berliner Mauerbau, dem Krieg in Vietnam und dem Prager Frühling auch real wurden. Die Wirtschaftskrise nach 1973 markierte sowohl für die Wohlfahrtsstaaten im Westen wie auch die sozialistische Planwirtschaft im Osten eine Zäsur. Die ökonomischen und gesellschaftlichen Voraussetzungen für Experimente in Bezug auf Wohnungsbau und Urbanismus fielen weg. Der Westen wandte sich in der Folge zunehmend vom industriellen Massenwohnungsbau ab während er im Osten zur Staatsdoktrin erklärt wurde und bis zum Ende der bipolaren Welt 1989 kaum neue Impulse erhielt.Der industriell gefertigte Wohnungsbau in Form von Grosssiedlungen entwickelte sich in den 1950er-Jahren zum etablierten Konzept, welches die akute Wohnungsnot der Nachkriegszeit beheben sollte. Diese Art der Bauproduktion war ein globales Phänomen der industrialisierten Nationen und überwand die ansonsten starke wirtschaftliche und politische Trennung und die divergierende kulturelle Produktion in den beiden Blöcken. Während sich die Repräsentationsarchitekturen bewusst voneinander abgrenzten, zeigten sich beim Massenwohnungsbau auffallende Parallelitäten der ästhetischen und städtebaulichen Lösungen. Im Rahmen des Forschungsvorhabens soll untersucht werden, inwiefern ökonomische, technische und ideologische Zwänge eine übergeordnete Struktur bildeten, die unabhängig von der Staatsform zu ähnlichen Ergebnissen führte.Die gleichzeitige und multiperspektivische Untersuchung von Projekten in der DDR, der Schweiz und den USA soll bei der Klärung grundsätzlicher Fragen an das Verhältnis von Architektur und Wohnungsbau dienlich sein. Die Ausgangshypothese ist, dass der Massenwohnungsbau der 1960er-und 1970er-Jahre als Produkt theoretisch bisher nicht erfasster Widersprüche zwischen Staat und Individuen verstanden werden kann. Zu diesen Widersprüchen gehören die Dilemmata zwischen dem Grundrecht auf adäquaten Wohnraum und dem Recht auf Eigentum und Gewinnschöpfung, zwischen dem öffentlichen und individuellen Interesse an einer ästhetisch hochwertigen Gestaltung und den ökonomischen Sachzwängen, denen der Wohnungsbau unterliegt.Das Forschungsvorhaben umfasst drei Subprojekte:A) Ein Technokrat ohne System.

Während Städte als eine Ressource für die Diversität von Fähigkeiten, Wissen und Erfahrungen gelten und Raum für die Produktion und den Verkauf von Gütern bereitstellen, tragen lokal eingebettete Ökonomien zu einer Kultur der Vielfalt und zur Intensivierung des städtischen Alltagslebens bei. Wissenschaft und Praxis sind sich darüber einig, dass nachhaltige Stadtentwicklungspolitik als dritte Säule die Stärkung der lokalen Ökonomie benötigt.Die lokal eingebettete Ökonomie umfasst Unternehmen, Netzwerke und Arbeitsformen, die über mannigfaltige Verflechtungen in die ökonomischen und sozialen Strukturen und Interaktions-beziehungen von Stadtquartieren eingebunden sind und von denen die Existenz und Entwicklung der städtischen Wirtschaft abhängt. Wobei diese nicht nur passiv in ihrem städtischen Kontext verankert sind, sondern aktiv zu seiner städtebaulichen Entwicklung beitragen. In Verbindung mit ihrem sozialen Kapital erzeugen lokale Teilökonomien urbane Nährböden, denen verschiedene soziale, kulturelle und ökonomische Prozesse folgen. Die wechselseitige Beziehung lokal agierender Ökonomien mit dem Raum wird im aktuellen wissenschaftlichen Diskurs vorwiegend aus sozio-ökonomischer Perspektive betrachtet. Was dazu führt, dass ihre räumlichen Effekte als spontane Ergebnisse ihrer urbanen Milieus verstanden werden, anstatt ihr Potential zur Steuerung von städtebaulichen Entwicklungsprozessen zu erkennen.Das Forschungsprojekt gründet demnach auf der Hypothese, dass lokal eingebettete Ökonomien eine entscheidende Rolle für die Umsetzung städtebaulicher Strategien spielen könnten, deren explizites Ziel es ist, das Innovationpotential von Stadtquartieren durch Heterogenität, Diversität und Interaktion zu verstärken. Ziel des Projektes ist es, über die wirtschaftsfördernde Wirkung lokal eingebetteter Ökonomien hinaus, ihre aufwertende Wirkung für Stadtentwicklungsprozesse und den Öffentlichen Raum bewusst einzusetzen. Um dies erreichen zu können, werden zuerst die genauen Mechanismen der Wechselbeziehung zwischen dem öffentlichen Stadtraum und lokalen Kleinst-, Klein- und Mittel-unterhemen in Zürich untersucht. Basierend darauf werden mögliche Strategien zur Instrumentalisierung ihrer Potentiale zur Steuerung der Stadtentwicklung in Richtung normative Ziele untersucht. Um die Wirkung und Steuerbarkeit der lokalen Ökonomie zu testen, werden einerseits Areale mit immanenten Potentialen zur Attraktion mittlerer, kleiner und Kleinstunternehmen ausgewählt und zweitens Areale mit einem hohem Entwicklungsbedarf.Ziele ist es mittelfristig, die Forschungsergebnisse anhand eines realen Pilotprojekts in Zusammenarbeit mit Experten der Soziologie und Ökonomie, Kleinunternehmern, Immobilieninvestoren und der Stadtverwaltung der Stadt Zürich in die Praxis zu überführen.

However, the phenomenon of people who spontaneously walk great distances on a regular basis has not been investigated. This is surprising since there is no doubt that such a behaviour is socially and politically desirable. In social marketing terms, people who walk a lot (for whom we have coined the expression “frequent walkers”) may be viewed as a pioneer population. It is therefore of strategic importance for several sectors of public policy to understand who these people are, how and where they walk, and why.Our group defines “frequent walkers” as people who walk at least three times more than the average in the same population. In Switzerland, this corresponds to a minimum of 5 km on an average day, an activity which takes at least one hour at a fast pace (5 km/h).We hypothesise that integrating an hour or so of walking into daily schedules is difficult for most people, which is why it is rare. We therefore hypothesise that frequent walkers have advanced navigation and organisational skills as well as a specific ability both to plan and improvise in time and in space. We also hypothesise that frequent walkers tend to congregate in areas which may or may not correspond to traditional walkability criteria, and that these “external” parameters combine with “internal” factors in order to explain the frequent walking behaviour.In the first phase of our research, we use available quantitative data from the Swiss 2010 transport micro-census to define the status of walking in Switzerland and understand where frequent walkers live, work, shop and walk. In the second phase, we resort to spatial analysis to identify the “hotspots” where most of the walking is done. In the third phase, we recruit frequent walkers in these hotspots, and using snowballing. Using qualitative interviewing and visits of areas where frequent walking takes place, we interact with the frequent walkers to understand their values, attitudes and motivations. Finally, we endeavour to understand how they have succeeded in integrating one hour or more of walking into their daily schedules, by equipping them with GPS emitters and following their walking behaviour, which is then discussed with them using procedures and software developed at EPFL.This proposal will help finance a doctoral thesis for Mr Derek Christie, who holds Master’s degrees in biology, statistics and public health, and who has experience in sustainable transport as well as health promotion.",Laboratory of Urban Sociology EPFL-ENAC-IA-LASUR,Lausanne,43861,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results",Switzerland,Not peer-reviewed,Contribution to book (non peer-reviewed), Walking in Switzerland: urban and not so leisurely ,"Christie Derek,  Ravalet Emmanuel,  Kaufmann Vincent",Published,2017,9781317271116,,,The Routledge International Handbook of Walking,,The Routledge International Handbook of Walking,,,92,99,The Routledge International Handbook of Walking,,Recently walking has been embraced as a means of encouraging greater health and well being community improvement and more sustainable means of travel.

This document series contains approximately 60.000 apprenticeship contracts, from 1573 to the year 1773. These contracts give precise information about the “masters” who were active in Venice in almost all kind of guilds. They also contain relevant information for understanding the functioning of their workshops or ateliers, documenting in particular where they were located. Whereas apprenticeship’s contracts are usually found scattered in the guilds’ archives or in the notary records, the “Accordi dei Garzoni” is a serial and compact source, which allows for a systematic method a study. Our project introduces a new approach for transcribing and studying such kind of document series. Exploiting the recurrent structure of these administrative records, a semi-automatic transcription process will be designed and tested. This process will feed a semantic database in which the content of each contract will be encoded, along with meta-historical information documenting the encoding process. The information extracted will then be aligned with a geo-historical database allowing spatial visualisation of the distribution of the workshops in Venice and the evolution of these patterns through time.The resulting, structured open access database will be used by our team of historians to investigate new research questions regarding the economy of apprenticeship, the links between apprenticeships, arts and architecture and the question of apprenticeship in relation with family and gender roles. As the database constituted in this project will be the largest and most detailed ever constructed on this subject, it is expected that this project will be the basis of renewed understanding of the transmission of technical knowledge between generations in early modern Venice. It also aims at pioneering a new computational approach for studying such kind of administrative document series.",DHLAB - Digital Humanities Laboratory College of Humanities École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne,Lausanne,526448,0000-0002-6991-5730,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication;Research Infrastructures",France,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Nobody knows exactly how the economy is evolving, how markets are looking in the future. However, the kind and the dimension of uncertainty can vary over time considerably. So part of the slump during the great recession is attributed to uncertainty. Some research also suggests that the reluctant investment behaviour after the great recession is partly attributable to a particular uncertain macroeconomic environment. It can therefore be assumed that uncertainty as a central variable in economic decisions is well defined and understood. However, at least from an economic perspective, not only a well-defined definition of uncertainty is lacking but also the causes for and the effects of uncertainty are. This research project intends, based on an already ongoing examination of and expertise about uncertainty at KOF, to close this gap and conduct a systematic assessment of uncertainty, both from a macro- and a microeconomic perspective in the following way:•Detailed comparison of different measures of uncertainty: Various measures of uncertainty are considered. The measures are calculated for Switzerland and a systematic comparison of these measures is intended. •Effect of uncertainty shocks on aggregated economic key variables: In particular the effect of uncertainty on private fixed investment is considered. On the one hand investment is a key variable in the business cycle. It often fluctuates strongly over cycles so that it is important to understand the effects of uncertainty on this activity. On the other hand, investment is important because its affects growth perspectives of an economy. •Effects of uncertainty on companies: This part of the project makes use of micro data and analyses the effects of uncertainty at the firm level. Because KOF conducts various regular business surveys (innovation survey, investment survey, business tendency surveys and special surveys) the institute provides its own data bases to the project. The three sub-projects analyse the main topic - uncertainty and its effects on business decisions and macroeconomic developments - from different angles. The project results will contribute to economic research but will also provide new insights for economic policy. It aims to give a comprehensive picture about uncertainty measures. It sheds light into the effects of uncertainty (and especially uncertainty shocks) to the business cycle. And it tries to get insight into the effect of uncertainty at the micro level.

Moreover, many projects are working on using blockchain tokens not only as a means of payment, but also to transfer rights ranging from claims, intellectual property to membership rights, i.e., shares.

Successful and permanent RTW requires that a person’s work-related capabilities and characteristics be compatible with the demands and characteristics of his or her job. Therefore, job placement approaches in vocational rehabilitation (VR) aim at matching person and job. However, while job matching has been extensively studied in organizational research with different types of person-job fit having been investigated, job matching has been studied to a much lesser extent in the RTW context and without systematically integrating person-job fit approaches from organizational research.Available generic job matching tools in the RTW context have shortcomings with regard to three essential requirements: (1) They are not occupation-specific and do not include the demands and characteristics of particular occupations; (2) they are not health condition-specific and do not capture work-related limitations and needs of persons with a particular health condition; and (3) they do not comprehensively address the fit between occupational and individual attributes and environmental factors influencing RTW. Persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) are a case in point of the need to develop job matching tools that comprehensively address occupation- and health condition-specific aspects in RTW. Affected people suffer from multiple health condition-specific limitations and are faced with various environmental barriers to work, leading to them being able to perform a limited spectrum of occupations. Therefore, the objective of this project is to develop a standardized documentation and assessment tool for job matching of persons with SCI. More specifically, this project aims to: (1) identify occupations performed by persons with SCI; (2) determine the occupations’ characteristics, demands and contextual factors; (3) establish (a) the work-related and health condition-specific needs and limitations of persons with SCI and (b) the environmental facilitators and barriers for RTW; (4) develop a multidimensional job matching profile for VR of persons with SCI; (5) operationalize and devise a rating scale for the established variables; and (6) examine the content validity of the developed tool.Conceptually, this project is based on the World Health Organization’s (WHO) model of functioning, disability and health (ICF), on biopsychosocial RTW models and on person-job fit approaches from organizational research. To address the study aims, a qualitative research design is applied that involves a multipronged data collection strategy consisting of database analyses, literature reviews, content analyses, focus-group interviews and expert interviews at various stages of the project. The Occupational Information Network (O*NET) is used for categorizing occupational demands and characteristics.The project integrates approaches from RTW and organizational research which have largely been developed independently so far and thus fills a crucial gap in the work reintegration of persons with disabilities. In addition, the project aims at a standardized and transparent assessment and documentation of person-job match, which will facilitate interdisciplinary teamwork in VR and improve the planning, carrying out and evaluation of interventions.

The present study aims to summarize and synthesize conceptual and empirical knowledge on job matching (JM) from industrial and organizational psychology (IOP) vocational psychology (VP) and return to work (RTW) research.  We conducted a scoping study applying Arksey and O'Malley's (2005) framework and using eight electronic databases from psychology economics and medicine. The literature search covered studies in English and German published between 1945 and 2015.  A total of 312 studies were selected and analyzed. Of these 205 were assigned to IOP 45 to VP 31 to both IOP and VP and 17 to RTW research. Fourteen studies were allocated to both RTW and VP research representing the field of vocational rehabilitation counseling. IOP and VP studies predominantly investigated the effects of JM on work related outcomes such as job satisfaction tenure or career development. RTW research focused on the development of mainly generic JM tools for job placement of persons with disabilities. Limited cross fertilization between IOP and VP and the RTW context became evident.  Unlike in IOP and VP there is a dearth of JM research in the RTW context. Integrating the broad organizational and occupational JM knowledge from IOP and VP with the biopsychosocial framework of RTW could provide a sound basis for developing JM applications in vocational rehabilitation counseling that promote sustainable work reintegration of persons with disabilities.

Drug-based treatments are highly effective on positive symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, but have limited efficacy on negative symptoms. Nonspecific psychosocial treatments have also shown few clinical effects on negative symptoms. Just as the psychosocial treatment of positive symptoms has improved by focusing more closely on delusion or hallucination, perhaps the psychosocial treatment of negative symptoms should also address specific targets. Recent literature has distinguished the negative symptoms associated with a diminished capacity to experience (apathy, anhedonia) from symptoms associated with a limited capacity for expression (emotional blunting, alogia). Anhedonia, which is defined as a reduction in the ability to experience pleasure, and apathy, which is related to a difficulty in anticipating the future, are good candidates for the development of a more specific psychosocial approach. Studies have shown that individuals with schizophrenia experience similar consummatory pleasure to controls, but less anticipatory pleasure. The combination of all these aspects led us to develop an intervention based on training the emotional and cognitive skills specifically needed to increase anticipatory pleasure in patients complaining of anhedonia or a lack of desire to engage in activities. A pilot study for the Positive Emotions Program for Schizophrenia (PEPS) demonstrated the intervention’s feasibility. Preliminary results indicated that participation in PEPS was accompanied by a significant reduction of anhedonia, apathy, and depression in a group of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders. Aim: Using a randomized clinical trial (RCT), the proposed study will compare the efficacy of using PEPS to reduce symptoms of anhedonia and apathy against treatment as usual (TAU). Methods: Eighty participants diagnosed with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder will undergo one or the other intervention for eight weeks. The study’s main hypothesis is that patients who have attended 8 one-hour sessions of PEPS will have lower total apathy-avolition and anhedonia-asociality scores on the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), in comparison to the control group. The secondary hypotheses are that PEPS will increase patients’ capacity to savor pleasure, anticipatory pleasure, and consummatory pleasure. The study will also monitor the sustainability of PEPS’ potential benefits at a six-month follow-up. The necessary sample size was estimated using the results of the pilot study. Socio-demographic and clinical data will be collected using validated psychometric instruments, as will levels of psychotic symptoms, depression, and ability to savor, anticipate and consummate pleasure. Between-group differences in pre- and post-test values will be examined using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for each outcome variable. Cohen’s d effect sizes will be calculated: between subjects at post-test and follow-up and within-subjects between pre- and post-tests in correcting for dependence among means in order to directly compare the effect sizes from other studies. Expected results and impact: This RCT will test the clinical efficacy and potential sustainability of PEPS. Increasing the ability of individuals with schizophrenia to experience pleasure may have an impact on key elements of their recovery process, such as hope and motivation. The short duration of the training needed for professionals, and brief intervention itself, make PEPS quite easy to implement in a variety environments.",Institut et haute Ecole de Santé La Source HES-SO,Lausanne,560232,0000-0002-1132-9472,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication;Exchange of personnel",Switzerland,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),Confirmatory Factor Analysis of the French Version of the Anticipatory and Consummatory Interpersonal Pleasure Scale,"Chaix Joséphine,  Golay Philippe,  Fankhauser Caroline,  Nguyen Alexandra,  Goodin Diane C.,  Favrod Jérôme",Published,2017,,10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01296,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01296/full,Front Psychol,,Front Psychol,8,1296,1296,6,Front Psychol,,The Anticipatory and Consummatory Interpersonal Pleasure Scale (ACIPS) a measure specifically designed to assess hedonic capacity for social and interpersonal pleasure  was used to evaluate the presence of social anhedonia in patients as well as the  general population. The first goal of this study was to validate the structure of the  French version of the ACIPS. The second objective was to verify whether a one two  or three factor solution is most appropriate for the ACIPS scale. The French version of  the ACIPS was tested on 263 French speaking pre graduate students or professional  volunteers. For the confirmatory factor analysis data were treated as categorical ordinal  and all the models were estimated using a robust weighted least squares estimator  with adjustments for the mean and variance. Three models were estimated. A onefactor  model representing a general undifferentiated “pleasure” latent construct was first  tested on the 17 ACIPS items. A two factor model distinguishing anticipatory pleasure  and consummatory pleasure was tested next. Finally a three factor model including  subdomains of intimate social interactions group social interactions and social bonding  was tested. The one and two factor models showed a somewhat poor fit to the data.  However the goodness of fit of the three factor model was adequate. These results  suggest that individuals who enjoyed interaction in one of these three subdomains  were more likely to enjoy doing so in the two other domains. However on the basis  of the comparison between the one and three factor models these three types of  interactions may not be considered as indistinguishable. Rather they represent distinct  and theoretically meaningful dimensions. These results show the French version of the  ACIPS is a useful and valid scale to measure the capacity of savoring different kinds of  social relationships.,163355,"Media relations: radio, television",Stimuler les émotions positives des personnes avec une schizophrénie,http://avisdexperts.ch/videos/view/4981,2016

Extensive and systematic recor-dings include utterances of 42 professional singers, actresses/actors, and non-professional speakers. Sounds of the long German vowels /i, y, e, ø, ?, a, o, u/ in V, sVsV, and minimal pair condition are investigated with varying basic production parameters such as pitch, vocal effort, production style, and phonation type. Additional references for “average” conversational speech are also created. Acoustic analysis (single sounds) and statistical analysis (sound samples) are conducted. Perceptual vowel quality is investigated in listening tests. In total, a corpus of more than 30'000 utterances of 42 speakers is created in order to build up an empirical reference on the matter.Up to now, our analyses provide strong indications for the following: (1) Possible vowel discrimination on high pitches up to F0 of c. 880Hz. Neither spectral undersampling nor “oversinging” statistical F1 is found to directly impair vowel discrimination. (2) Depending on vowels and F0 ranges, lower spectral peaks and, if determinable, related formants < 1.5kHz shift with rising F0. These shifts are found for both professionals and non-professionals, and a substantial part of them are indicated to maintaining the perceived vowel quality. (3) Speaker group differences in the vowel spectra < 1.5kHz decrease or disappear when comparing sounds at similar F0 levels. (4) Visual inspection of the spectra in general confirm reported findings in the literature of increased intensity in mid and high spectral ranges and SF for professionals. However, methods of acoustic analysis need further investiga-tion. Moreover, the effect of these acoustic characteristics on vowel perception is also in question. (5) No robust evidence for SPF was found, which may be due to the recording procedure applied.Need for clarification: On the basis of these indications, major aspects of stage-specific as well as of general voice production and perception have to be addressed: Firstly, for a clarification of phoneme and text intelligibility on high pitches, additional recordings of comic and voice-over actresses/actors are needed. Secondly, clarification of the observed F0-dependence of lower spectral characteristics (of importance for the concept of formant tuning) requires resynthesis and high-pass filtering experiments. The same holds true for the clarification of speaker group differences. Thirdly, the relation between F0-dependent changes of vowel-specific spectral characteristics and articulation should be clarified requiring a parallel investigation of sound production and imaging of the vocal tract or measurement of its resonances, respectively. Fourthly, the relation between F0-dependent changes of vowel-specific spectral characteristics and cortical representation should also be clarified. Fifthly, the acoustic effect of the levels of spectral intensity of different frequency bands and the shaping of the spectral envelope > 2.5kHz needs to be clarified requiring additional recordings live on stage, including additional investigation of SPF.The present follow-up project addresses these issues within the following experiments: Additional recor-dings (in the studio and live on stage in a large concert hall); vowel synthesis (related to statistical formant patterns) and resynthesis (related to natural vocalisations) with extensive F0 variation, testing constancy/alteration of vowel perception; vocal tract investigation (with MRI, with vocal tract resonance measurement), testing the parallelism between vowel-specific spectral characteristics of sounds produced on very different F0 and articulation; investiga-tion of cortical vowel representation (with EEG), testing constancy/alteration of the representation for vowel sounds on very different F0.-Listening tests are included in all experiments.-Great effort is also made for an extensive open access publication (entire sound database and eBook).-Improvement of the methods of acoustic analysis for sounds on high pitches is attempted for in the ongoing project.The empirical basis provided-unique in its systemacy and extension-and the clarifications attempted will allow for in-depth insight into the acoustics of stage voices, into general aspects of vowel acoustics, and into some important and related aspects of production, perception, and cortical processes, indispensable for further research and for an assessment of the relevance of acoustical descriptions for vocal education and the use of technical aids on stage.",Institute for the Performing Arts and Film Zürcher Hochschule der Künste,Zürich,520015,0000-0002-0036-1282,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results",Germany,Peer-reviewed,Proceedings (peer-reviewed),Why a phenomenology of vowel sounds is needed.,MaurerDieter,Published,2018,,10.18452/18805,https://edoc.hu-berlin.de/handle/18452/19531,Proceedings of the Conference on Phonetics & Phonology in German-speaking countries ,"Humboldt Universität Berlin,Berlin",Proceedings of the Conference on Phonetics & Phonology in German-speaking countries ,,,,,Proceedings of the Conference on Phonetics & Phonology in German-speaking countries ,Berlin,In the literature there is an extensive and often controversial debate on the primary acoustic and perceptual cues of vowel quality resulting in two main viewpoints that these cues are contained in either the formants or alternatively in the spectral shape. However in our understanding one aspect is highly underestimated: the fact that any spectral representation of vowel quality is directly or indirectly pitch related. Hence a given formant pattern as well as a given spectral envelope is in many – if not all – cases ambiguous in terms of representing sounds of different vowel qualities if speakers equal in size and gender produce the sounds on very different pitches. Neither of the two above mentioned viewpoints can account for this issue however. – The present paper (i) summarises the ongoing debate (ii) describes the empirical evidence for pitch related spectral representation of vowel quality (iii) concludes that existing approaches to determine the acoustic cues for vowel quality do not account for all recognisable vowel sounds both conceptually and methodologically and (iv) argues for the need of a phenomenology of the acoustics of vowels in terms of building up large scale language specific sound descriptions addressing all variations of production parameters and their possible extension relevant for perceived vowel quality. ,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Not only did the known world expand dramatically in the hundred years preceding Donne’s period with the discovery of the Americas and subsequent European colonial expansion, but the discoveries of Kepler and Galileo meant that the known universe too had expanded, which raised theological and ontological questions regarding the place of man in the cosmos. On the level of church government, the Reformation led to a shift in alliances and enmities that restructured the map of Europe. The Reformation also had spatial implications for church worship, both in the reorganisation of church interiors and in emerging Protestant hostility towards the visual arts. Yet this is a period which also sees major changes regarding the way space is represented, with knowledge about developments in the visual arts in Italy, such as the introduction of one-point perspective, gradually reaching England during Donne’s lifetime. Similarly, scientific innovations in cartography in the fifteenth century, combined with the invention of the printing press, meant that the newly expanding world was documented more accurately than ever before. Donne’s period thus witnessed major changes in the spatial conception of the material and political world, as well as significant changes in how space was recorded, both cartographically and aesthetically. This project investigates the ways in which such macro- and micro-cosmic changes in the perception of space are reflected and recreated in John Donne’s poetry and prose. The multiple spheres in which Donne operated during his lifetime (scholar, lover, diplomat, preacher) meant that he was implicated in many of the changes outlined above. The different strands of this project combine together into a sustained argument that not only does John Donne represent changes in society and his concerns about them in spatial terms, but that there is also a spatial structure to his writing which encodes and remakes the developing material spaces of the society in which he lived. The methodology of the project thus involves both a historical contextualisation of Donne’s spatial references, and an in-depth close analysis of the structures of his texts. The project has three key strands: one PhD thesis investigating public and private spaces in Donne’s secular poetry (Songs and Sonnets, Elegies and Satires); a second doctoral thesis dealing with the problematisation of space in his religious poetry and prose sermons; and a book-length study by the principal applicant of the relationship of Donne’s poetry to changes in the visual arts of the period. Together, these three projects will provide a comprehensive survey of Donne’s work in the context of the spatial reorganization of his period, and will argue that his work both reflects that spatial reorganization and engages intellectually and poetically with questions related to space and the visual arts.

The proposed research project will investigate age-related differences in implicit theories about willpower and their age-differential outcomes. Previous research documented that the effects of implicit theories about willpower on self-control depend on the preceding self-regulatory demands: A limited-resource theory predicts impaired self-control performance after previous self-control exertion in the lab and during times of high self-regulatory demands in everyday life (Job et al., in press). Due to age-related losses in physical and cognitive resources, older age is associated with increasing self-regulatory demands. Therefore, I assume that with increasing age implicit theories about willpower exert a greater effect on people’s self-regulation, goal striving, and consequently their well-being. Two cross-sectional studies, which were conducted in preparation for this proposal, provide first evidence that age moderates the effects of willpower theories on goal-related self-regulation and subjective well-being. Believing that willpower is a limited resource is associated with impaired goal-related self-regulation and decreased subjective well-being, particularly in older adults. In a series of four experiments (three laboratory experiments and an experimental field study), the proposed research will test the causal effect of willpower theories and investigate the perceived availability of physical and cognitive resources as a mediating mechanism. Together, these studies will provide important insight into the processes of dealing with age-related losses and self-regulatory demands, both of which contribute to successful aging.",Psychologisches Institut Universität Zürich,Zürich,549729,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",Germany,Peer-reviewed,,Age differences in implicit theories about willpower: Why older people endorse a nonlimited theory.,"Job Veronika,  Sieber Vanda,  Rothermund Klaus,  Nikitin Jana",Published,2018,,10.1037/pag0000285,,Psychology and Aging,,Psychology and Aging,33,6,940,952,Psychology and Aging,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It embraces a time frame that constitutes a critical period of history that has hardly ever been studied as a continuum because of language and discipline barriers that have prevented scholars from working on the same research questions in widely overlapping time periods. Very few studies on this transitional period from a Christian to a Muslim society have considered the whole range of sources - in Greek, Coptic and Arabic. Yet, only a full appraisal of all relevant evidence allows one to analyze continuities and disruptions during the transition from Christianity to Islam. It thus needs to be stressed that only close cooperation between various experts will lead to an understanding of the subject since no single scholar can be an expert in all these different fields. This project is therefore truly cutting edge and is aimed at closing the gap between arbitrarily set historical periods, different languages, and disciplines.Considering the challenges of the evidence, it is no wonder that this crucial period of history nestledbetween the disciplines of Byzantine studies, medieval studies, coptology, papyrology, ancient history and earlyArabic studies has been largely neglected so far. A comprehensive treatment of the period from the last years ofByzantine rule, the impact of the invasion of Egypt by the Arabs and the political, cultural and socialconsequences of Muslim rule for the Egyptian population has therefore been a long-term desideratum.

Eléments pour une archéologie de la pensée moderne » Résumé du plan de recherche :Plongeant leurs racines dans la philosophie et la science de la Grèce antique, les notions de matière, de lieu et d’espace sont au cœur de la philosophie et de la science occidentales. Pendant la période antique et médiévale, les approches philosophique et scientifique de ces notions relèvent d’un même système du savoir, unitaire et englobant, à l’intérieur duquel elles fournissent des théories et des analyses de nature différente, mais qui s’avèrent complémentaires. Ainsi, dans la culture philosophique du Moyen Age on trouve une physique, une métaphysique et une théologie (philosophique) de la matière et du lieu/espace. Dans le champ théorique de la physique, ces notions sont examinées en rapport au devenir du monde matériel et conçues - notamment à partir du XIIIe siècle - dans le sillage de la 'Physique' d’Aristote ; en métaphysique et en théologie leur pertinence est mise en rapport à des entités non-corporelles (âme, esprits, « substances séparées ») et à la réalité divine, donnant ainsi lieu à l’élaboration d’une conceptualisation nouvelle. Une reconstitution exhaustive des conceptions médiévales de la matière et de l’espace exige par conséquent l’examen de ces trois approches. Le but de ce projet de recherche est de contribuer à une telle reconstitution en étudiant le traitement de ces notions dans le cadre de la métaphysique, en particulier en relation aux entités sui generis que sont les « substances immatérielles » ou « intelligences séparées ». Plus précisément : (1) le premier objectif de ce projet est d’examiner un important corpus de textes remontant aux années 1280-1350, produits principalement dans le cadre de la tradition franciscaine et de la première « école scotiste » en particulier. Ce corpus de textes fait en effet état d’élaborations et d’hypothèses novatrices qui opèrent un dépassement significatif de la physique aristotélicienne alors dominante et préparent les élaborations ultérieures des concepts de matière et d’espace. (2) Compte-tenu de l’importance du scotisme dans l’optique des développements successifs des thèmes étudiés, le deuxième objectif du projet est d’examiner la réception des théories analysées sous (1) dans quelques écrits particulièrement significatifs de Francisco Suarez (1548-1617), envisagé dans sa fonction de vecteur de transmission de la scolastique vers la première époque moderne. Cet examen permettra d’identifier les éléments des théories médiévales de la matière et du lieu/espace susceptibles d’avoir exercé une influence sur les élaborations que ces notions connaîtront à l’aube de la modernité.",Département de Philosophie Faculté des Lettres Université de Fribourg,Fribourg,34921,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",Italy,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),Metaphysische Antipoden?

Since the establishment of Yellowstone at the end of the 19th century, the national park concept has been transferred to a large and astonishing diverse number of political, social and environmental settings world-wide. Following this global proliferation - 18 parks or park projects do exist in Switzerland alone - , national parks and protection areas, particularly those located in the global south countries, have become a large and complex topic for political ecologists’ studying within the fields of contemporary human geography. Within this topic, political ecologists have highlighted how inherently political this form of land use is, as well as the important role that specific social, political, historical, economic and environmental contexts play in park negotiations, and in the types of spaces and places that are produced and reproduced.  This project will undertake a comparison of the Abel Tasman national park of New Zealand and Park Adula candidate national park of Switzerland. The aim here is to explore environmental evaluations and the justifications attached to these evaluations, in their specific social, political and environmental contexts, in order to identify and understand distinctive moral foundations within the negotiations that surround the development and management of national parks. Key emphasis will be placed on understanding the way moralities are reflected in the spaces and nature produced in parks, and what moralities are carried in the meanings and understandings attached to national parks? Taking up the call for a transfer of global south political ecological insights and methods to global north contexts (and thus closing a gap), a comparison will be used as a method rather than an aim, to explore and contrast the role of the contexts on the moral values within the production of national park spaces. The theoretical framework for understanding and comparing these moralities will engage with Thévenot, Moody & Lafaye (2000) work on cultural comparisons of patterns of evaluation and justification, with an aim to view the effect that these moral struggles have on the production and reproduction of spaces of and places in national parks. In both case studies ethnographic methods and analysis of documents (including text and images) will be used to gain understandings of the moralities embedded within the ordinary practices of park actors as they participate in park negotiations. A strong component of this comparative aim is the close collaboration of researchers including two PhD students based at the Universities of Fribourg and Zurich in the development and implementation of data collection and analysis methodologies. This project’s contribution to broader debates is thus twofold: first, to put the role of morality onto the agenda of research and management of national parks in the global north. Second, to go a step further than stating that context is important in environmental debates, by enquiring into what these contexts mean for the emergence of conservation moralities.",Unité de Géographie Département des Géosciences Université de Fribourg,Fribourg,547268,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results",Switzerland,Not peer-reviewed,Other publication (non peer-review),What is a national park for?

A sharp dichotomy between reason and emotions, and the idea that emotions are irrational forces interfering with rational agency, have had a strong presence in the history of Western thought.  However, philosophers working recently on emotions have questioned that dichotomy and tried to offer a more positive assessment of the role of emotions in human agency. We shall propose that a joint examination of Chinese and Græco-Roman theories of emotions can contribute to this development. Methodologically, this project is unique in using expertise in two different intellectual traditions to make a claim with broader philosophical impact. Our basic hypothesis is that all major thinkers in both these ancient traditions - including the notorious anti-emotionalists such as Stoics - believed that the good life requires an “art of feeling”: a disposition to feel in the right way. Rationality is only one of several norms operating here. Even those Greek philosophers who divided the human soul into rational and non-rational part(s), most notably Plato and Aristotle, envisaged the good life in terms of a close cooperation between reason and emotions. The Chinese material is particularly relevant for this project because emotions were not juxtaposed with “reason”. Moreover, qing ?, the approximate equivalent for “emotion” in early Chinese, originally means “true nature”, so emotions were typically associated with a positive expression of what is authentic.This ability to feel is best understood as an art, like playing tennis. Both are 1) relatively stable, long-term dispositions that, 2) can be learned; and indeed must be learned if we are to possess them. Both are 3) objectively assessable in terms of performing better or worse. This assessment relates 4) to the appropriate intensity of the performance or 5) the appropriate approach. The art of feeling, therefore, is not an art of regulating or constraining feelings where the art corresponds to reason, and feeling to the object or material of reason. Rather, it is feeling itself which has been developed so that it has its own wisdom, just as the virtuoso player does not blindly obey the instructions of his trainer but himself knows how to do things, sometimes in a manner that even a good trainer is not able to explain. To do justice to this view, we prefer to talk about “feeling” (in singular) as a fundamental way of being active in relation to the world rather than about (the multiplicity of) “emotions” as alien forces or passive states into which we fall. Instead the idea of reason that regulates or constraints emotions we prefer to talk about feeling that has its own reasons. We can, of course, be paralyzed by our emotions (or feelings) but such cases - perhaps except some exceptional circumstances, in which we think it is appropriate to be fully overwhelmed by a feeling, which is the sort of decision that only a virtuoso of feeling can responsibly make - can be assessed in terms of a failure to exercise our activity of feeling in the right way. One reason this perspective is adequate with regard to the ancient material is that the ancient thinkers often considered emotions as long-term dispositions rather than fleeting episodes. Firstly, this project will provide a better historical understanding of different Græco-Roman and Chinese theories of emotions in the context of their time and tradition. On the Chinese side, we shall work with Warring States texts (475-221 BCE), including the texts excavated recently at Guodian; on the Græco-Roman side, we shall work mainly with Hellenistic and early Imperial texts (3rd c. BCE - 1st c. CE). Our hypothesis is that in both traditions these frameworks fall roughly into two groups: dualistic and holistic. According to the dualistic view, embraced by Xunzi or Plutarch, feelings are akin to desires and should be cultivated by being moulded by a structure external to them: typically this is “reason” in the Græco-Roman tradition, and “ritual” (li ?) in the Chinese tradition. The holistic view (Stoics, Mengzi, Zhuangzi) says that feelings are closely linked to value judgments: mastering the art of feeling is transforming the beliefs informing these feelings. We shall try to assess what actually is the difference between the dualistic and holistic models, given that the result of the process is unitary in both cases. Secondly, these parallels between different models of the art of feeling in both traditions will provide a basis for achieving the comparative objective: to use the “art of feeling” to establish broader similarities and differences between both traditions. Finally, and thirdly, the historical and comparative analyses will reinforce the plausibility of the “art of feeling” as a basis for a new philosophical theory of emotions.

Zunehmender Erfolg von VolksinitiativenSeit Einführung der Volksinitiative auf Bundesebene im Jahr 1891 wurden lediglich 21 Initiativen von Volk und Ständen angenommen. In den Jahren zwischen 1949 und 1982 fand keine einzige Volksinitiative Zustimmung. Bis nach der Jahrtausendwende wurde die Annahme einer Volksinitiative als Ausnahmeerscheinung eingestuft. Daher beschäftigte sich die Forschung lange Zeit nur mit den indirekten Wirkungen von Volksinitiativen auf die Rechtsetzung und auf das politische System. Mittlerweile hat sich die Ausgangslage jedoch grundlegend verändert. Beginnend in den 1990er Jahren lässt sich in jüngerer Zeit eine Häufung erfolgreicher Volksinitiativen feststellen. So wurde in den Jahren 2008 bis 2014 mit Ausnahme des Wahljahres 2011 jeweils eine Volksinitiative gutgeheissen.II. Forschungsbedarf bei den rechtlichen Hindernisse für die UmsetzungAngesichts dieses Befundes drängt sich eine vertiefte Erforschung der Phase der Umsetzung von Volksinitiativen auf. Gesteigert wird das Interesse dadurch, dass bei der Mehrzahl der in jüngerer Zeit gutgeheissenen Initiativen im Zuge der Umsetzung rechtliche Schwierigkeiten auftraten. Problemfelder sind die Vereinbarkeit mit völkerrechtlichen Vorgaben sowie der Schutz der in der Bundesverfassung verankerten Grundrechte und rechtsstaatlichen Grundsätze. Häufig erweisen sich auch im Initiativtext verwendete Formulierungen als rechtlich wenig präzis.III. Umsetzung als Aufgabe aller staatlichen FunktionsträgerIn das Verfahren der rechtskonformen Umsetzung erfolgreicher Volksinitiativen sind alle staatlichen Gewalten involviert. In erster Linie ist die Bundesversammlung zur Umsetzung des Verfassungsauftrages berufen. Vorbereitung und Vollzug, regelmässig aber auch die übergangsweise Rechtsetzung unmittelbar nach Annahme der Initiative obliegen dem Bundesrat. Schliesslich ist die Rechtsprechung mit der Anwendung im Einzelfall befasst. So fällte das Bundesgericht viel beachtete Urteile zum Verwahrungs-, zum Ausschaffungs- und zum Zweitwohnungsartikel.

Einerseits beeinflussen die vom Autor erwartete und intendierte Rezeption seines Werks, sein Wissen oder seine Annahmen über die Erwartungshorizonte möglicher Rezipienten, bereits im Schaffensprozess die Faktur des Buches; andererseits wirkt das Buch im Sinne des klassischen Rezeptionsbegriffs in seiner so geschaffenen, situativ bedingten und zugleich historisch einmaligen materiellen Gestalt bei seiner Aufnahme durch die jeweiligen historischen Rezipienten wiederum auf seine Umgebung zurück. Diese medialen Prozesse können, müssen aber nicht der Intention des Produzenten entsprechen. So schafft das Buch durch den Produzenten bewusst inszenierte bzw. sekundär aktualisierte Anschlussstellen für die individuelle, kollektive und institutionelle Identitätsbildung wechselnder Rezipienten.Die so gefassten literarischen Reproduktionskulturen werden im Projekt anhand von fünf prägnanten Fallbeispielen über eine breite historische Zeitspanne vom 14. bis zum Beginn des 17. Jh.s analysiert. In allen Fällen sind zugleich editorische Neuerschliessungen geplant, die stets vom ganzen Buch, seiner Entstehung und seinem Gebrauch, nicht vom Einzeltext ausgehen.",,,60614,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication;Research Infrastructures;Exchange of personnel",Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Peer-reviewed,Book (peer-reviewed),"Der Codex im Zentrum der Gemeinschaft.

Femme, laïque, écrivaine et mystique sous le règne du « Roi Soleil », Madame Guyon fait preuve d’une liberté spirituelle et intellectuelle inouïe pour l’époque. Restée veuve très jeune, elle entreprend une vie aventureuse et propage ses idées mystiques d’abord à Thonon, en Savoie, puis en Italie et à Grenoble. Introduite à Versailles en 1689, elle réunit autour d’elle un groupe d’aristocrates dissidents ainsi que Fénelon, précepteur du petit-fils de Louis XIV, et crée la Confrérie secrète des Michelins, mouvement politique et religieux utopique qui intriguera la Cour et propulsera Madame Guyon au cœur d’une violente querelle. Définie par Louis Cognet une « célèbre inconnue », Madame Guyon a fait l’objet de nombreuses études au cours du XXe siècle. Cependant l’historiographie s’est concentrée notamment sur la question du quiétisme et sur le thème du « pur amour », sans aborder de manière systématique les implications sociales et politiques de sa pensée religieuse. Le projet se propose donc de combler une lacune de taille dans le domaine des études sur le mysticisme et l’histoire des idées religieuses de l’époque moderne. Les conditions pour y parvenir sont au nombre de deux, l’une d’ordre méthodologique, l’autre de nature conceptuelle. La première consiste à analyser le corpus guyonien en croisant les écrits théoriques avec les sources biographiques et à situer et réinscrire sa doctrine dans le contexte spirituel, politique et culturel de l’Ancien Régime, afin de saisir la dialectique entre vie contemplative et vie active caractérisant cette figure parfois déroutante du Grand Siècle. La seconde demande l’élaboration d’une grille de lecture interprétative qui interroge l’œuvre de Madame Guyon à partir de deux dimensions complémentaires qui recèlent des enjeux fondamentaux, et qu’on ne distingue ici que pour des raisons de clarté :1. Un axe théologique-anthropologique qui conduit à mettre en tension les notions d’identité et de différence, d’action et de passivité parsemant les écrits de l’auteur. En assumant cette perspective analytique il devient ainsi possible d’étudier, au cœur même de la doctrine mystique de l’anéantissement, l’émergence d’une nouvelle identité sociale et l’affirmation d’une identité féminine transgressive de nombreux codes ou interdits imposés par l’époque.2. Un axe politique-éthique qui analyse le statut théorique et pratique de la Confrérie des Michelins à partir d’une clé de lecture originale, à savoir la notion de simplicité. Cette approche permet de faire ressortir le contraste entre la société du temps et la vision mystique de l’auteur, et d’esquisser l’ « éthique de la simplicité » sous-jacente à la pensée guyonienne. Du point de vue méthodologique, une attention particulière sera également prêtée au contexte historique et politique ainsi qu’aux réactions, amies et ennemies, des contemporains vis-à-vis d’une femme mystique (mais laïque) impliquée dans la vie sociale et spirituelle de son temps.Ce projet, qui s’inscrit dans le récent renouveau des études sur la mystique, vise la publication d’une monographie ; les deux premières années seront consacrées au repérage bibliographique, à l’analyse du corpus et à l’élaboration du plan, la troisième à la rédaction. Par ailleurs, la deuxième année du projet coïncidant avec le troisième centenaire de la mort de Madame Guyon, un colloque international sera organisé à Genève.

As preterm birth is increasingly common, it is important to understand processes impeding or facilitating socio-emotional development and mental health of preterm children and adolescents. There is evidence that bio-physiological, neuroendocrine, and behavioral factors including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis) function, sleep quality, neuronal plasticity (as indicated by levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor; BDNF), and physical exercise play an important role for socio-emotional development and mental health. As adolescence is a developmental period of fundamental psycho-social change and particularly increased risk for the onset of socio-emotional and mental health disturbances, it is a research priority to study risk and protective factors during the transition to adolescence. However, longitudinal research on preterm children studying the role of HPAA-function, sleep, neuroplasticity, and physical exercise during the transition to adolescence is missing.Objective: We aim at testing the following hypotheses within an interdisciplinary approach.1) Adolescents born preterm show more socio-emotional difficulties and more mental health problems, altered HPAA-function, lower levels of sleep quality, and lower levels of BDNF compared to controls.2) Altered HPAA-function, poor sleep, and low levels of BDNF are related with socio-emotional difficulties and mental health problems in adolescence. We expect the relation to be even stronger in preterm born adolescents due to their generally increased vulnerability for behavioral and emotional problems.3) A high level of physical exercise is positively related to socio-emotional development and mental health during the transition to adolescence. Again, we expect the relation to be even stronger in preterm born adolescents due to their generally increased vulnerability for behavioral and emotional problems. Moreover, we expect high levels of physical exercise to be related with HPAA-function, favorable sleep patterns, and higher levels of BDNF.Design and Method: The study includes a cohort of very preterm born adolescents (< 32nd week of gestation), born in Basel with birth years 6/2001-12/2005, as well as age and gender matched term born controls, who participated on a first measurement wave during childhood (altogether N = 190 children; 96 preterm and 94 full-term children, who were assessed during childhood in an earlier phase of the project). The proposed study comprises one follow-up measurement wave of this sample during early adolescence (ages 12;0 - 14;12 years). The follow-up sample during adolescence is expected to include n = 75 adolescents born very preterm and n = 75 adolescents born full-term. Planned measurement includes (a) parental and adolescent-report questionnaires (assessing adolescents’ socio-emotional development and mental health, physical activity/exercise, as well as parenting behavior and peer relationship quality), (b) paper-based assessment of socio-emotional competence (MSCEIT-YV) and cognitive development (WISC-IV)), (c) interviews with adolescents regarding their mental health (Kinder-DIPS), (d) assessment of adolescents’ HPAA-function by saliva samples and hair cortisol, (e) one night of sleep EEG/polysomnographic-assessment, (f) seven nights and days of actigraphy/activity monitoring and sleep diary, (g) blood samples to assess BDNF concentration.  Relevance and impact: The study will provide information on the role of HPAA-function, sleep quality, neuronal plasticity, and physical exercise for socio-emotional development and mental health of preterm children during the transition to adolescence. Interventions to improve socio-emotional development and mental health of preterm and full-term born adolescents will profit from the newly generated evidence.",Department of Psychology University of Warwick,Coventry,520487,0000-0002-1314-6194,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results",Switzerland,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),Salivary and hair glucocorticoids and sleep in very preterm children during school age.,Maurer N.

Moreover there is evidence for a relationship between HPA axis activity and sleep. However research with objective sleep measures in very preterm children during school age is rare. Eighty five healthy children born very preterm (<32nd gestational week) and 91 full term children aged 7–12 years were recruited for the present study. To assess HPA axis activity salivary cortisol was measured at awakening 10 20 and 30 min later. In addi  tion hair cortisol and cortisone concentrations were quantified using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to assess cumulative endocrine activity over the preceding months. One night of in  home polysomnographic sleep assessment was conducted to assess sleep duration sleep continuity and sleep architecture. Children born very preterm showed significantly lower levels of cortisol at awakening and lower overall post awakening cortisol secretion lower cortisone in hair and earlier sleep onset than full term children. Across the whole sample overall post awakening cortisol secretion was positively related to sleep onset time and negatively to sleep duration. The association between prematurity status and post awakening cortisol secretion was partially mediated by earlier sleep onset time. In conclusion this study provides evidence for a possible down regulation of the HPA axis activity and slightly earlier sleep phase in very preterm children during school age.,159362,"Media relations: print media, online media",Mothers' insomnia may affect children's sleep quality,https://www.spektrum.de/news/schlechter-schlaf-setzt-sich-in-der-familie-fort/1498783,2017

Auf der Basis einer vergleichenden Analyse von Pressefotografien wird nach der visuellen Signatur dieses Krieges im späten 20. Jahrhundert, nach Traditionen westlicher Balkanbilder und nach Spezifika der medialen Vermittlung des Konflikts in den drei Untersuchungsländern gefragt. Durch die Kombination historischer und bildwissenschaftlicher Analysemethoden verspricht das Forschungsvorhaben einen umfassenden Erkenntnisgewinn zur visuellen Darstellung militärischer Gewalt in der Gegenwart und zur Prägung kognitiver Karten Europas durch den fotografischen Blick des „Zentrums“ auf die „Peripherie“ des Kontinents.Bewaffnete Konflikte wurden schon immer in Bildern festgehalten - sei es in Gemälden, in der Fotografie oder im Film. Auch der Jugoslawienkrieg, der 1992 Bosnien-Hercegowina erfasste und mit der knapp vierjährigen Belagerung Sarajevos die Welt in seinen Bann zog, wurde über Bilder in die weltweite Öffentlichkeit getragen. Mit ihrem emotionalisierenden Potenzial sprechen Fotografien eine vermeintlich universale und unmissverständliche Sprache. Allerdings kann es keinem Bild je gelingen, den Krieg und seine Realität angemessen und objektiv wiederzugeben. Vielmehr ist Kriegsfotografie stets standortabhängig und Bestandteil gesellschaftlicher Diskurse über den Krieg: Sie ist von Vorstellungen geprägt und wirkt selbst auf solche zurück. Wie beeinflussten Berichte über den modernen „Balkan-Krieg“ die fotografische Darstellung des Konflikts? Welche Akteure und Mechanismen wirkten an der Entstehung der visuellen Repräsentation des Bosnienkriegs mit? Wie beeinflusste die Kriegsfotografie die gesellschaftlichen und politischen Debatten über die Verantwortung der europäischen Staatengemeinschaft auf dem Balkan? Diese Leitfragen stehen im Mittelpunkt des Forschungsprojekts. Die Untersuchung erfolgt dabei in drei Schritten:Nach einer systematischen Erfassung des Quellenmaterials soll erstens die Bildsprache der Fotografien einer historischen und ikonologischen Analyse unterzogen werden. Dabei interessiert vor allem, welche Motive und welche Aspekte des Krieges Eingang in die fotografische Darstellung fanden, welche visuellen Mittel dabei verwendet wurden und aus welchen Elementen sich das entsprechende „Bild“ des Bosnienkriegs formierte. In diesem Kontext wird auch der Entstehungs- und Verbreitungsprozess von Pressebildern rekonstruiert und nach beteiligten Akteuren (Fotograf_innen, Bildagenturen, Redakteur_innen) sowie deren Sichtweisen und Motiven gefragt. Zweitens wird der Blick auf die Geschichte westlicher Sehgewohnheiten des „Balkans“ gerichtet und die Darstellung des Bosnienkriegs der 1990er Jahre mit Elementen der westlichen Balkan-Ikonografie des späten 19. und frühen 20. Jahrhunderts verglichen. Auf diese Art sollen Traditionen und Brüche der westlichen Wahrnehmungsgeschichte der südöstlichen Peripherie des Kontinents (Balkanismus) identifiziert und analysiert werden. Auf einer dritten Ebene werden die Presseberichterstattung über den Bosnienkrieg und die visuelle Repräsentation des Konflikts in deutschen, österreichischen und schweizerischen Medien untereinander verglichen. Dabei soll nach Gemeinsamkeiten und Spezifika der Darstellung bzw. nach der Rolle unterschiedlicher historischer Bezüge des jeweiligen Landes zur Kriegsregion gefragt werden.

Within smaller and medium-sized countries and in any given year, the number of such events falls short of any magnitude allowing meaningful analyses. Therefore, establishing national databases has been a promising way of improving knowledge in this field. By collapsing data over longer periods of time, the number of murder cases easily reaches “interesting” dimensions. This is particularly important given the heterogeneity of homicide. Contrary to current wisdom, homicide is not simply an expression of a society’s violent tendencies. Rather, the label “murder” includes many different constellations that may have highly disparate causalities. Therefore, it is necessary to collect data on a large number of variables related to individual circumstances of homicides.The aim of the present project is to build a database containing all intentional homicides committed in Switzerland from 2005 to 2014. A large number of variables will be collected, as for examples demographic and other relevant information about the victim and the offender, circumstances of the homicide (where, when and why the act happened) and details of the court proceedings. The integrated variables are chosen in a way that allows the participation in the European Homicide Monitor as well as a comparison with the former Swiss homicide-suicide database to detect crime trends.Data collection will start by identifying homicide cases at Forensic Medical Institutes.

During these years wireless underwent a crucial metamorphosis: before the First World War it was mainly conceived as a point-to-point medium and after it also became a one-to-many medium better known as radio broadcasting.This project seeks to establish for the first time a pan-European dimension, presuming that wireless was an international technology in many aspects. From a political point of view, wireless waves could hardly be restricted to national boundaries and, for this reason, international rules were established early. Furthermore, wireless was seen by national governments as an international weapon of communication and its control became crucial for states like the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and later the U.S.A. From an economic perspective, wireless market was supra-national: huge private companies such as British Marconi Company, German Telefunken, and French Société Générale struggled to acquire dominant positions in a European and, later, global markets. Finally, wireless was European also in terms of users. Radio amateurs, whose relevance increased in many European countries during the 1910s, aimed at communicating to each other and at listening to common contents such as the Eiffel Tower signals. National policies and markets were reaffirmed through radio broadcasting, but at the same time broadcasting had an inter- and transnational dimensions: frequencies had to be distributed in order to avoid overlapping, new international companies were created to produce radio sets, and early radio listeners were fascinated by European listening.   The main research questions of this project are: 1. Wireless could have been used for national communication just like wired telegraphy or telephony, but it was quickly perceived as a long distance medium for international communication. Why? How was this long distance “nature”, not inherently embedded in the technology itself, co-constructed? 2. Why and how did European regulations, business strategies, technical options, and users’ demands affect the development of wireless? Are there significant differences between wireless and radio broadcasting?3. How were new media, like wireless and broadcasting, understood at that time by “different social groups” such as politicians, investors, technicians, and users? And how were these different views conflicting?4. Historians often claim that the turning point between wireless telegraphy and radio broadcasting was the First World War. How did this European conflict transform one medium into another? How was wireless telegraph/telephone used during the war and how did these uses favor/discourage the “broadcasting option”? 5. Finally, what can the origins of wireless telegraphy and radio broadcasting say on the cultural origins of long standing concepts for XX century media history, such as frequencies, freedom of the spectrum, “virtual” communities, and point-to-point/one-to-many media?   This project seeks to answer these and other questions by conducting research on the basis of historiographical methods. Its methodological approach is based in the field of media history, with contributions from the political economy, economic history, international relations and institutions history, and finally audience studies in order to reconstruct the cultural history of two media (radiotelegraph and broadcasting) which emerged from one technology (wireless).","Institute of Media and Journalism Faculty of Communication, Culture & Society Università della Svizzera italiana",Lugano,533359,0000-0001-7752-277X,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication;Research Infrastructures",Luxembourg,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),The final days of the rai hegemony: On the sociocultural reasons behind the fall of the public monopoly,"Richeri Gabriele,  Balbi Giuseppe",Published,2015,,10.1386/jicms.3.1-2.63_1,,Journal of Italian Cinema and Media Studies,,Journal of Italian Cinema and Media Studies,3,1-2,63,79,Journal of Italian Cinema and Media Studies,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Because of the novelty of this research object, the guiding question is to what extend approaches and theories  of direct supplier management are transferable to buyer - supplier - sub-supplier triads. Deduced from this guiding question the project plans to answer the following research questions over a course of a 2 year project:RQ1: To what extend do direct-supplier contracts , requiring suppliers to pass on buyer requirements to their suppliers, improve sub-supplier compliance with buyer requirements.RQ2: To what extent do sub-supplier specific investments improve sub-supplier compliance with the buyer requirements?Supply chains are broadly understood as global networks of interlinked multiple supplier buyer relationships. In current management research, the focus regarding theories, approaches and methods in supply chain management is predominantly limited to dyadic relationships between buyers and their direct supplier (Mena et al., 2013, Mentzer et al., 2008). As a rather new phenomenon, stakeholders increasingly exert substantial pressure on buying firms by holding them accountable for the behavior of both suppliers and sub-suppliers in their entire supply chains (Lee, 2008, Hartmann and Moeller, 2014, G7, 2015). Consequently, firms need approaches to manage sub-suppliers, ultimately increasing efficiency and decreasing risks associated with quality, availability, legal compliance (e.g. intellectual property), or environmental or social responsibility along multi-tier multinational supply chains (e.g. Grimm et al., 2014a, 2014b; Wisner and Tan, 2000). The academic discussion on multi-tier supply chains receives increasing attention (Mena et al., 2013, Tachizawa and Wong, 2014; Hofstetter et al., 2013, 2014, 2015), although empirical work is still very scarce.This research proposal intends to investigate on one side the simplistic practice of delegating responsibility for sub-supplier behavior to suppliers, suggesting that sub-supplier management were a sequence of discrete buyer-supplier relationships - avoiding sub-supplier specific investments (e.g. financial contributions, training and knowledge exchange). On the other side, this research proposal intends to analyze if sub-supplier specific investments impact sub-supplier performance, what further factors alter this influence, and under which conditions they are made.The grant applicants have already published research results on mechanisms used by buyers to influence sub-suppliers (e.g. Grimm et al., 2011, Peters, 2009). For this research proposal, the applicants will use a large data set consisting of information on the compliance of producer companies with social standards (data provided by the Business Social Compliance Initiative, BSCI) as well as a data set detailing buyer supplier sub-supplier relationships. This creates a direct link between the buyer and its requirements with the sub-supplier with its performance. The BSCI is a voluntary sector initiative of consumer goods and textile manufacturers and retailers to monitor and improve social performance in the supply chain. This data set consists of 45.000 third-party audits showing longitudinal compliance of sub-supplier with buyer requirements.The observation points are collected through external audits that test sub-supplier compliance with the sustainability requirements of the buying organizations. A long established relationship between LOG-HSG and BSCI  makes it possible for us to gain access to members and conduct interview about their individual experiences with sub-supplier specific investments and compliance.",Lehrstuhl für Logistikmanagement Universität St. Gallen,St. Gallen,519569,,Publication,Netherlands,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,165814,"Media relations: print media, online media",Challenges of sub-supplier management - from a cross industry perspective,,2017

Hygiene held a special place in the imagination of Africa and was central to the reordering of religious, scientific and colonial knowledge at home. This project is interested in the networks, which facilitated the circulation and allowed for the transfer of hygienic knowledge in Europe. Firstly, the Protestant missionary movement had a background in European social history. It linked the mission of hygiene that targeted the immoral living conditions of the working class at home to the mission fields abroad. Secondly, hygiene dominated scientific debates about the prevention of tropical diseases and the elevation of health conditions in the colonies. Thirdly, the pursuit of hygiene was one significant way in which civilisation was imagined. The project of ‘civilising’ Africa became a question not only of intellectual or emotional co-option to European ideas and beliefs, but also one of hygiene and practice. The civilised mind was to be acquired through the clean and healthy body.Why the Basel Mission doctors? The focus of the study lies on the six Basel Mission doctors working on the Gold Coast and in Cameroon between 1885 and 1914 and thus contributes to a reorientation of mission history towards wider issues in cultural history. The Basel Mission played a pivotal role in the circulation and transfer of knowledge about the colonial world in Switzerland, a country without formal colonies. The Basel Mission doctors embodied the link between Protestant missionary activities overseas and the consolidation of scientific medicine in Europe. By shaping discourses and practices of hygiene, they were central actors in the missionary, scientific and colonial spaces of knowledge. This project starts with the sending of the first Basel Mission doctor to the Gold Coast in 1885 and ends with the retreat of the Basel Mission from West Africa in 1914. The period of research opens up a unique historical configuration, which stimulated the networks, circulation and transfer of hygienic knowledge. The heyday of Protestant medical missions abroad coincided with the emergence of tropical medicine as a distinct scientific discipline during what became known as the ‘Scramble for Africa’.Why missionary knowledge? Missionary knowledge was a particularly interactive form of knowledge due to its global scope, practical approach and material resources. Firstly, the Basel Mission doctors acquired local knowledge of faraway places, which made them valuable scientific observers. The relatively late institutionalisation of tropical medicine at the turn of the 20th century meant that it had to draw on existent missionary knowledge about the tropics. Secondly, the practical approach of the Basel Mission doctors ensured that missionary knowledge moulded ideas and practices of hygiene beyond the world of the Church or academia. Their accounts on tropical hygiene found wide recognition and formed an important basis for conceptions of cleanliness, purity and civilisation. Thirdly, objects, drawings and photographs held a special place in the Basel Mission serving as both teaching resources and propaganda material. The important body of material the Basel missionaries acquired between West Africa and Europe developed an own agency and inscribed missionary knowledge in multiple spaces of knowledge.What does this project show? In the process of professionalization of tropical medicine in the early 20th century, the Basel Mission doctors gradually lost their scientific credibility. At the same time, however, their knowledge on tropical hygiene captured the attention of colonial authorities and a general public concerned with the settlement of Europeans in the colonies. The project examines basic dimensions of European contemporary history by showing the religious fabric of both the scientific and colonial projects. Simultaneously, the integration of missionaries in the history of knowledge escapes the danger of implying that religion is an ahistorical field, to be characterised without reference to scientific, social and political developments. The altering importance attached to missionary knowledge enables us to see how Christian notions of purity, scientific discourses and colonial conceptions of civilisation interacted to constitute hygienic knowledge at home.",Departement für Historische Wissenschaften - Zeitgeschichte Universität Freiburg,Fribourg,529495,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results",Germany,Not peer-reviewed,Contribution to book (non peer-reviewed),"Der schwarze Körper als Missionsgebiet 1880–1960.

The ontological divide between entia naturalia and entia moralia constitutes a decisive preparation for the “Humean moment” in the way of thinking about norms (both legal - in Book III of the Treatise of Human Nature - and moral).

This study aims to bring additional light to this important question by examining the earliest systematic labor market experience by individuals in developed economies: the process of applying for an apprenticeship position and the role employers might play in fostering occupational gender segregation.  In order to identify whether employers take gender into consideration when evaluating employment applications, a correspondence test will be conducted. The study will select occupations that are commonly perceived as being male (or female), as well as other occupations that are viewed as more gender neutral,  and will compare the success rate of both genders across those.  The statistical comparison of success rates in invitations for interviews of males and females across these different occupation types will allow us to address the question of whether potential differential treatment is stereotypical in nature or otherwise systematic.",Chair of Microeconomics Department of Economics University of Fribourg,Fribourg,589052,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this movement, a role still little-known but important was played by a network of actors, both Swiss and political exiles, who contributed to the movement of the libertarian education and to the experiences of secular and popular education experimented by socialist and progressive movements, like “modern schools”, popular universities and popular conferences, university extensions, etc.Among them, we find a group of geographers who were both ‘inventors’ of libertarian pedagogy and primary figures in their discipline: the exiles Élisée Reclus (1830-1905) and Pëtr Kropotkin, (1842-1921) and their Geneva collaborator Charles Perron (1837-1909), founder of the Cartographic Museum with William Rosier (1856-1924), and author of some of the first internationalist pamphlets for popular and secular education. These scientists shared direct collaboration with libertarian educators like Francisco Ferrer y Guardia (1859-1909), Sikko Roorda van Eysinga (1825-1887) and his son Henri (1870-1925) or Jean Wintsch (1880-1943), the two latter animators of the Lausanne École Ferrer (1910-1919).We stress also the role of James Guillaume (1842-1917) and Ferdinand Buisson (1841-1932), the first a Swiss, the second a Frenchman exile under the Second Empire, which were cultural transferors of the idea of secular education among different nations and political milieus. They were both the redactors of the celebrated Dictionnaire de pédagogie et d’instruction primaire and important builders of the French system of primary public education, which was accompanied by the foundation of libertarian schools like the Cempuis orphanage, financed by the Ministry of Public education but directed by the anarchist Paul Robin (1837-1912), who had knew Guillaume and Buisson during his exile in Switzerland. So, the French Republican School has some roots in Switzerland: which was in that the role of the local tradition of Rousseau and Pestalozzi? Which was the link between exiles, left-libertarians and liberals in this historical conjunction where we can assume that Switzerland has taught to the World? Which was the role of liberal Protestantism? Which was the importance of human sciences like history and geography, this latter practiced by several of the quoted authors? Which was the influence of the exiles in the Swiss cultural history and in the invention of libertarian pedagogy, whose themes keep a great modernity? Can we trace a link between past and present, talking about any echoes of these debates remaining in the present Plan d’Études Romand (PER) recently adopted in Francophone Switzerland? Our aim is to answer to these questions analyzing systematically the little-exploited works and archives of the quoted authors and institutions, dealing with their Swiss and international networks and with the circulation of their pedagogical, political and political knowledge, to explain better the links existing between the cited situations.This research aims to realize an international conference, the publication of scientific works and papers in English and French, a PhD dissertation (Candoc), a qualitative enquiry concerning a sample of Geneva teachers of the secondaire 1, and a cycle of meeting/conferences on the pedagogy of social sciences and civic education, in the context of the Geneva IUFE activities for teachers’ training, envisaging the production of specific didactic materials.

It will focus in particular on the use of computer simulations in order to produce models of brain architecture and function, not so much in order to simu-late cognitive processes as such ('weak' rather than 'strong' Artificial Intelligence according to a distinction proposed by Searle 1980). In classical computational neuroscience, action potentials are modeled by computing numerical solutions to mathematical equations such as the influential Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) equations, which do not admit of analytical solutions. This approach mirrors the traditional use of computer simulations in other areas of science, e.g., physics, climate science or economics. However, in contemporary neuroscience there is also a bewildering variety of other simulation techniques that may or may not resemble the traditional approach. These techniques have rarely been examined from a philosophy of science point of view.This project will closely investigate the simulation practices of contemporary neuroscience. A first goal will be to provide a survey of different uses of simulation in the contemporary neurosciences. In a second stage, it will treat these simulations as providing scientists with specific counterfactual conditionals the antecedents of which are modeling assumptions and the consequents describe some possible neurological state, structure or process. This counterfactual analysis will be used in a third stage to provide a more integrative view of the different scientific activities of simulation, modeling, experimentation and thought experiments. The relationship between these different scientific techniques has been controversially discussed in the philosophical literature. Viewing them all as involving some kind of counterfactuality will enable us to better understand the commonalities as well as differences with respect to their epistemic role. The project will be an integrated part of the DFG Research Unit (DFG-Forschergruppe) 'What if? On the epistemological, pragmatic, psychological and cultural significance of coun-terfactual reasoning' (2015-2018, grant application pending), which is a continuation of the existing research unit 'What if?

Research on skilled migration tends to focus on social, cultural, political and economic dimensions of knowledge-based societies within a globally multifaceted context. The focus on small diaspora communities within industrialized countries/regions is not fully recognized, though they deserve attention.The aim of our project  is to understand how or to what extent tensions emerging between different aspects of globalization shape the experiences and activities of highly qualified migrants. The empirical reality of globalization includes different elements such as movement of ideas, people and goods. Theories of transnationalism permit to examine different facets and processes of globalization. However, concepts of transnationalism seem to be challenged by streams of renationalization such as changing migration policies and discourses on national identities. Such contradictions may provoke antagonistic tendencies calling for research exploring the present situation of highly qualified migrants, which could offer specific findings and insights of great value. The phenomenon of highly qualified migration is a significant part of today’s globalization (OECD, 2008). It creates the necessity to negotiate relationships across and within localities. Biographies and narratives of distinctive groups of highly qualified migrants allow us to analyse how life experiences and activities are shaped across a multifaceted context. Furthermore, theories of life-modes (Højrup, 2003, 2013) and justification (Boltanski & Thévenot, 2006) serve as frameworks to position highly qualified actors within globalization processes and to explain their activities. This approach provides us with an opportunity to make sense of the events and actions highly qualified migrants live with and how they articulate themselves. It will also allow us to understand how these migrants think they play a part in the structure of today’s “glocalization”.Data will be generated through interviewing highly qualified migrants and using an ethnographic approach that will entail participant observation. This will also be the case when using general data such as migration policy discourses, descriptions of life conditions and opportunities. The project consists of two subprojects focusing on distinctive groups of highly qualified migrants:• Subproject A: Swiss in Israel and Israelis in Switzerland• Subproject B: Swiss in Senegambia and Senegambians in SwitzerlandThe historical, sociocultural, political and religious characteristics defining the specific groups of migrants and their countries of origin and destination create a distinct profile. There are surprisingly many Swiss living in Israel and an important number of highly skilled Israelis living in Switzerland (BFS 2010). The image of Senegambia migrants in Switzerland has long been negatively shaped by the low skilled migrants from the region who often come to Switzerland as asylum seekers. However, they are now beginning to be perceived as agents contributing to the development of their country of origin (IOM, 2013). The subprojects take up transnationalism as a theoretical concept and globalization as an empirical reality, both of which will be studied through the prism of the migration of the highly skilled. Simultaneously, the tensions and contradictions of arising nationalist or ethnic arguments on “culture” will have to be addressed. A transnational context produces what we call multi-sited biographies that are justified in the narratives of the protagonists. This represents a societal antagonism between high mobility versus the desire for settlement and stability; and between policies on migration and national profiling versus the demands for trained experts. We will explore how or to what extent globalization shapes life experiences, the justification of transnational activities amongst highly qualified migrants and how they position themselves within a globalized but localized setting. The sampled groups of migrants allow us to understand the precise role of attributions and labelling in terms of ethnicity, race, gender, nationality, profession, and religion within and across multiple locations.We will investigate three aspects: 1) life-modes, context and daily life surroundings, 2) narratives of identity, biography and experiences, and 3) justifications and criteria of decision-making. The following three research questions will be tackled:1. How is the daily life of highly qualified migrants influenced (or not influenced) by transnational surrounding conditions and local frameworks in a positive or discriminatory way?2. What biographical experiences and expectations shape the self-image, narratives of “identity” and social belonging of highly qualified migrants?3. What criteria and knowledge-based objectives of individual decision-making are at the basis of transnational/local activities of the highly qualified migrants?The project will use qualitative methods and findings drawn from anthropology and sociology and informed by the concerns of African studies, Jewish studies, Near Eastern studies and European studies. The significance of carrying out such joint research is highlighted and recognized by scholars (Cheng, Young, Zhang & Owusu, 2014; Klekowski v. Koppenfels, Mulholland & Ryan, 2014; Amelina, Faist & Negriz, 2012). Research on transnational migration tends to focus on a single group within a single locality. In contrast, we intend to grasp how different localities, surroundings and frameworks may lead to varying experiences and negotiations. We anticipate diverse outcomes and findings that could provide a way to understanding different groups of migrants within different localities. Historical, cultural, religious and visibility/non-visibility factors, etc. could have a major impact on life-modes, experiences and decision-making. The project will be embedded in an institute that is strongly dedicated to providing an interdisciplinary atmosphere and a cluster of researchers focusing especially on migration, the life of highly skilled migrants, and ethnographic transnationalism.",Seminar für Kulturwissenschaft und Europäische Ethnologie Universität Basel,Basel,73215,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Research Infrastructures",Senegal,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),Mobilität - der Weg zum Erfolg?

In the brain, the parietal cortex may form spatial maps allowing such remapping, where the representation of visual locations is partly centered on gaze direction, but modulated by eye movements. Thus, a stimulus in the left visual field must be held in spatial memory by the right parietal cortex (and vice versa) when gaze moves to another location, but is dynamically transferred to different neurons within the map that correspond to the new retinal location of the stimulus. Deficits in spatial remapping might therefore be consequence of damage to the parietal cortex, and could potentially contribute to the symptoms of spatial neglect in stroke patients. Neglect is a perplexing, disabling, and frequent neuropsychological syndrome, in which patients fail to perceive and orient attention to stimuli in contralesional space. There is emerging evidence for remapping deficits in neglect patients, obtained from a few studies examining double step saccades or spatial memory after eye movements in different (right vs left) directions. However, the neuroanatomical basis of spatial remapping abilities remains unexplored, in both normal and pathological conditions (after stroke). Furthermore, theoretical accounts of attention have highlighted functional and neuroanatomical similarities between attentional processes and eye movement (premotor theory of attention). However, the exact relationship between remapping and attention shifts (vs overt gaze shifts) is unresolved and has never been directly assessed, neither in patients nor in healthy people. These two issues will form the main objectives of our project.Our specific goals are (1) to clarify the role of covert attention in spatial remapping, (2) determine the influence of remapping deficits on neglect symptoms, (3) identify brain lesions crucially implicated in these deficits, (3) delineate cortical networks recruited during visual and attentional remapping in the normal brain. To these aims, our project will combine psychological, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging techniques in three parts. The first part will systematically compare spatial remapping with and without eye movements (visual and attentional remapping tasks, respectively), in patients with focal hemispheric stroke with and without spatial neglect. Lesion mapping analysis will identify the structural neuroanatomical basis (common and/or distinct) for these two spatial remapping defects. A series of standard neuropsychological tests will also be given to probe for other spatial deficits associated with neglect and examine their links with remapping defects. In the second part, we will use fMRI in healthy controls to investigate the normal brain networks activated during both types of spatial remapping, and compare them with lesion analysis in patients. The third part will examine remapping with another neuropsychological task testing for the ability to update and anticipate remembered locations in space across gaze shifts, and constitute an exploratory attempt to train remapping abilities, in order to determine any potential benefit for future rehabilitation approaches in neglect patients.Altogether these results will improve our knowledge of spatial cognition in humans and clarify the nature of abnormal space perception in neglect. Our findings should yield important new insights into the nature of spatial remapping mechanisms and more generally spatial awareness.

Previous work has demonstrated visual remapping activity in parietal cortex during saccades but it remains unclear whether remapping is triggered by overt saccades only (or by attentional shifts also) and whether it engages parietal areas only (or other cortical areas). Here we used fMRI to investigate spatial remapping during two visuospatial memory tasks requiring either overt (accompanied by a saccade) or covert (with central fixation) attention shifts to peripheral distracters. Participants had to remember the position and color of a lateralized dot during a saccade or attention shift requiring them to update the dot position in memory and then indicate if a second dot matched the first. Differential activation patterns were observed within parietal cortex as a function of the different visual motor and interhemispheric remapping demands in the saccade task presumably mediating the maintenance of spatial position in perceptual and motor maps. Remapping engaged parietal areas adjacent to but not overlapping with those activated by saccade execution while it did not engage the frontal eye fields pointing to distinct neural substrates for ocular motor and spatial updating processes. No differential activation related to remapping was found during the covert attention shift task suggesting that this condition did not necessitate the same remapping as the saccade condition. Overall these results further elucidate the mechanisms of spatial remapping in human parietal cortex and their relationship with attention processing and ocular motor behavior with implications for understanding visuospatial attention deficits in hemispatial neglect.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While recent literature on organizational corruption started to address the rising and heterogeneous challenges for internationally operating companies in a globalized economy (Becker, Hauser, & Kronthaler, 2012; Gebhardt & Müller-Seitz, 2011; Schembera & Scherer, 2014), our knowledge is so far mostly restricted to large firms. For example, these studies outline how and why large Multinational Corporations (MNCs) changed their organizational structures to fight corruption after a recent wave of corruption scandals. In contrast, we know little about the role, motives and challenges of internationally operating small and medium enterprises (SMEs)  as regards the fight against corruption.This research project will analyze the implications of firm size on the fight against corruption at internationally operating companies. While in recent years, scholars have created knowledge on the role of SMEs in managing corporate social responsibility (CSR) (Baumann-Pauly, Wickert, Spence, & Scherer, 2013; Jenkins, 2004; Spence, 1999; Wickert, 2014), implications for particular issues, such as corruption, have been largely unaddressed so far (as an exception, see:  Hauser & Kronthaler, 2013). Combining existing insights from studies on CSR and research on organizational corruption, we face a puzzle of partially contradicting expectations: (1) The CSR literature suggests that, despite their limited resources, internationally operating SMEs may pursue an approach of solving societal problems that is not necessarily inferior to the one of large MNCs (Jenkins, 2004; Murillo & Lozano, 2006; Wickert, 2014), whereas (2) particular insights from the corruption literature suggest that SMEs face greater challenges in fighting corruption and are more likely to be involved in corrupt practices (Aterido, Hallward-Driemeier, & Pagés, 2011; Bennedsen, Feldmann, & Dreyer Lassen, 2009). Moreover, whereas large MNCs of high visibility and prominence were forced to respond to increasing expectations to fight corruption after a series of scandals threatening their legitimacy (Pfarrer, Decelles, Smith, & Taylor, 2008; Schembera & Scherer, 2014), SMEs so far were mainly untroubled by such scandals (Hauser & Kronthaler, 2013) and feel less pressure to respond to external expectations (Beck & Walgenbach, 2005). Clarifying the role of SMEs in fighting corruption, as part of the responsibility of business firms, hence is a challenging issue.The following are central questions that arise from this puzzle: What are the actual organizational differences between SMEs and MNCs in fighting corruption? Why are there differences and how did they develop over time? How can the development be explained? Based on these findings, can we identify whether one approach of fighting corruption is ‘inferior’ to the other? Put differently, how can SMEs, as opposed to MNCs, fight corruption?The aim of this project is hence to analyze and explain the differences between small and large firms in fighting corruption, and ultimately be able to develop recommendations on how firms can fight corruption depending on their size. To do so, we suggest dividing this project into three parts that build upon each other and, taken together, provide a comprehensive investigation on the role of firm size in fighting corruption. First, we aim to explain in detail the process of how and why SMEs actually fight corruption by conducting in-depth qualitative analyses. In a second step, we want to investigate the generalizability of central findings derived from our case study by conducting a quantitative longitudinal analysis. For example, we aim to explain the influence of (limited) firm visibility and (limited resources, yet) distinct capabilities at SMEs on their organizational anti-corruption processes and structures. Or, if national identity has been identified as a crucial factor affecting the fight against corruption at SMEs and MNCs differently, we may apply insights from integrative social contracts theory (Bailey & Spicer, 2007; Donaldson & Dunfee, 1994) to the issue of corruption and test the hypothesized influence empirically. Finally, based on our empirical findings, we aim to conceptualize a framework outlining recommendations how SMEs can fight corruption tailored to their particular organizational characteristics, competences and challenges.The project is designed to make the following contributions: First, it will contribute to clarify the role of SMEs in fighting corruption. In particular, it generates empirical knowledge on the differences and drivers of organizing anti-corruption in SMEs compared to MNCs. Further, the development of a normative conceptual framework aims to further integrate SMEs in the debate on the societal role of a business firm and provide an anti-corruption agenda ‘tailored’ for SMEs. Thereby, the project will not only open up a research agenda for future empirical research on fighting corruption at SMEs but may also contribute to the development of conceptual SME-tailored models addressing other CSR issues such as climate change or Human Rights abuses.",Lehrstuhl der Grundlagen der BWL und Theorien der Unternehmung Universität Zürich,Zürich,503523,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results",Netherlands,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),Organizational strategies in the context of legitimacy loss: Radical versus gradual responses to disclosed corruption,"Schembera Stefan,  Scherer Andreas Georg",Published,2017,,10.1177/1476127016685237,,Strategic Organization,,Strategic Organization,15,3,301,337,Strategic Organization,,How do organizations respond to the loss of legitimacy in the context of disclosed corruption and what drives the particular responses adopted? In this article we study the organizational strategies of three multinational companies before during and after legitimacy loss due to disclosed organizational corruption. We explore why some multinational companies exceed regulatory expectations and choose radical strategies that substantially influence their environment by defining a new benchmark of anti corruption practices while others follow a more gradual approach. We build on the concept of legitimacy in institutional theory and  focus on three strategies that organizations tend to adopt to regain legitimacy: isomorphic adaptation moral reasoning and strategic manipulation. Based on our empirical study we suggest that when a transgression is accompanied by a strong legitimacy shock transgressors are likely to see no alternative but to react both radically and instantly. We identify two distinct extremes of strategic manipulation: decoupling and substantial influence.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

During the 19th century, Italy is inundated by conduct manuals. There are at least 186 original editions, whereas in the previous century publications on good manners were very few and far between. Our purpose is to explain this stark numerical contrast as indicative of the birth of a new concept of politeness that emerged when the political turmoil of the previous century caused the decline of the aristocracy. Ancien Regime politeness is governed by the principle of 'discernment': it is based upon highly conventional formulae that are determined by the rank of the participants and by the ceremonial required by the context: politeness is a matter of following a set protocol and, above all, showing the correct amount of deference. We anticipate that, during the 19th Century, social conventions lose their imperative character. Although they survive in very specific contexts (diplomacy, e.g.), elsewhere a new social order emerges, in which the individual determines a polite way of behaving, by negotiating contextual expectancies, social and more local norms, alongside his personal goals. The project is testing this hypothesis for the 186 conduct manuals, published in 19th Century Italy. We will study the birth of contemporary politeness through three interdisciplinary research questions: 1) How is (im)politeness conceptualised in these prescriptive texts and with what type of argumentation is it justified both as a general concept and as a set of specific rules? 2) Do the dialogues in these treatises contain language forms that are being positively or negatively evaluated in metacomments? 3) What metaterms are used within metapragmatic evaluations ('affettuoso', 'gentile', 'freddo'...) and what arguments are used to justify these evaluative comments? We intend to examine, within the context of 19th century Italian conduct manuals, the intimate connections between the concepts of (im)politeness, linguistic forms of (im)politneness and evaluative language of (im)politeness. After gathering the corpus from libraries in Tessin and in the North of Italy, the texts will be scanned and digitalised. It will then be lexicalised with a concordancer that will allow the extraction of (im)polite concepts, forms and metaterms. The identification of (im)polite concepts, forms and metaterms will be executed partially through a manual annotation, in a multi-method approach. Importantly, we will only define a language form as polite or impolite as and when the text itself tells us a language form is polite or impolite: as we are working with historical materials, the 21st century researcher cannot anticipate what is polite or impolite unless he knows how politeness or impoliteness is defined and evaluated by the text itself. Situated at the crossroads of pragmatics of (im)politeness and historical pragmatics, the project follows a discursive, second wave approach, which we want to integrate with the dialectical and rhetorical dimensions of argumentation, in order to reconstruct, punctually, the historical 'reasons for politeness'.

They foster the articulation of distinct social and cultural imaginaries, addressing plural audiences. Research in African art, however, tends to either emphasize art production with a long local or regional history or art that is embedded in and speaks to the contemporary international artworld, targeting a transnational or global rather than a local audience. This division results in two separate bodies of research; anthropological and art historical. This project aims at overcoming these shortcomings by adopting a thoroughly interdisciplinary approach addressing multiple art practices and the formation of social spaces as one.Art as practice is unavoidably embedded in a social context and creates a social space. Whether this space is more local or more international or bridges the two is an open question that only empirical research can answer. Some artists embrace an activist position; others demonstrate social sensibility while still others see their art as an aesthetic intervention in public and private spaces. All these art practices may reflect social realities and in turn shape the formation of social and cultural spaces: Urban images are perceived, conceived, and lived through art and social spaces created through artistic practice. The dialectic relationship between artistic articulation and social space transgresses dichoto-mies such as private-public or local-global. At an empirical level, this project hence aims at understanding aesthetic practice and processes of artistic articulations as part of the creation and transformation of social spaces in urban Africa. Its central question is:•How does art as a part of expressive culture inform the formation of social space? This question will be examined from three complementary perspectives: 1.) How do artists aesthetically articulate images of the social within these spaces? 2.) How do these images and practices inform social imaginaries, and how do the latter inform those of the artists? 3.) What are the dialectics between social imaginaries and imageries, and their visual and performative forms of expression (pictures, films, performances, participatory art, etc.)?Our empirical approach is based on an understanding of art as social agency that un-folds in urban lifeworlds and that shapes and is shaped by the urban. Methodologically, this project thus focuses on artists, their art practices, their audiences, and the interrelation between physical sites and virtual spheres as social as well as political spaces. We will address the interaction of individual artists, artists’ associations and art practices with specific social actors, representing different social strata and groups. Therefore, we also need to examine art practices that apparently do not take place in public places but ad-dress urbanites in other, sometimes secluded social and political spaces. Based on long-term field research, the two applicants together with two PhD students will engage in a comparison of four African cities: Kampala (Uganda, Siegenthaler), Kisumu (Kenya, PhD student) in East Africa and Bamako (Mali, PhD student) and Korhogo (Côte d’Ivoire, Förster) in West Africa. The researchers start from existing contacts to artists and associations and will enlarge the scope of their inquiries as defined by specific milestones. The comparative approach will generate general knowledge about the production of social space through art in Africa and theoretical insights in how the formation of social space is related to imageries and imaginaries of the social.The project is also a network of exchange and cooperation with African artists and art institutions, including the Research Group on Visual Culture at the Institute of Social Anthropology Basel and university departments of art and anthropology at the Universities of Cocody, Bouaké, Kampala and Eldoret.

Children and adolescents, who think that the experienced trauma has a permanent and disturbing impact on their actual life and their future, feel threatened. Study results show that dysfunctional posttraumatic cognitions correlate highly with posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), depression, and anxiety. In addition, children and adolescents with a posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have significantly more dysfunctional trauma-related cognitions than those without PTSD. Especially for children and adolescents it is important to consider interacting developmental and environmental factors. A developmental approach, nevertheless, has not been investigated yet.Aims: The aims of the proposed study are to achieve a better understanding of dysfunctional trauma-related cognitions considering child and environmental factors in a cross-sectional and a longitudinal design. Method: The sample consists of two different subsamples: 1) A hospital sample consisting of children and adolescents (school age: 7-18 years), who experienced an accidental trauma (either acute traffic accident or burn injury) assessed at three times: in the acute phase (7-14 days), 3 months, and 6 months after the trauma occurred. 2) An already existing clinical sample of 159 children and adolescents (TreatChildTrauma study), who mostly experienced an interpersonal trauma such as sexual or physical abuse. The total sample will be used to investigate the impact of child and environmental factors including trauma type, trauma frequency, age, gender, risk status pre trauma (psychopathological status pre trauma and traumatic events pre trauma), psychopathological status post trauma, and parental trauma-related cognitions. In addition, the hospital sample will be used for assessing the naturalistic time course of dysfunctional trauma-related cognitions as well as the association between cognitions, PTSS, depression, and anxiety over time. Moreover, the association between parental dysfunctional trauma-related cognitions and altered parenting as well as their impact on the child’s cognitions will be investigated. Relevance: Dysfunctional trauma-related cognitions have an important impact on coping with a traumatic event in childhood and adolescence. Nevertheless, no study has investigated the interaction between several child and environmental factors so far.

Trauma adjustment varies in children and adolescents. Studies on  objective risk factors of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) yielded inconsistent  results. Dysfunctional posttraumatic cognitions (PTCs) might play a mediating role  between risk factors and posttraumatic symptomatology.  Objective. To investigate the interplay of the characteristics of the trauma (e.g. trauma  type) the characteristics of the individual (e.g. age sex) and the characteristics of the  social environment (e.g. parental distress marital status) on PTSS and depression  taking the child’s dysfunctional PTCs into account as a possible mediator.  Method. Structural equation modelling was used to better understand trauma  adjustment in two heterogeneous samples of children and adolescents: a sample of  114 participants aged 7 16 after accidental trauma and a sample of 113 participants  aged 6 17 after interpersonal trauma.  Results. In the accidental trauma sample dysfunctional PTCs mediated the positive  associations of younger age and lower parental educational level on child PTSS but  not on depression. In the interpersonal trauma sample being female positively  predicted child depression. Furthermore parental dysfunctional PTCs positively  predicted both child PTSS and depression. No mediation effect of child dysfunctional  PTCs was found in the interpersonal trauma sample. Child dysfunctional PTCs  moderately to strongly predicted child PTSS and depression in both trauma samples.  Conclusions. The impact of the characteristics of the individual and the characteristics  of the social environment on child PTSS and depression might depend on the type of  trauma experienced. Dysfunctional PTCs mediated between the characteristics of the  individual and the characteristics of the social environment and the severity of PTSS in  the aftermath of accidental trauma but not of interpersonal trauma.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Indem es nach Religionskonzepten in der russischen Wahrnehmung des Orients fragt, greift es aktuelle Debatten in den Fächern Religionswissenschaft, Slavistik und Osteuropäische Geschichte auf. Es erweitert damit den religionswissenschaftlichen Blick auf einen bisher wenig bearbeiteten geografischen Bereich und bereichert die Diskussion um den „russischen Orientalismus“, die in den auf Osteuropa spezialisierten Fächern seit zwei Jahrzehnten geführt wird, um eine neue, religionswissenschaftliche Perspektive. Das Projekt untersucht, mit welchen Kriterien in wissenschaftlichen Werken, literarischen Texten und Reiseberichten (wissenschaftlichen und/oder literarischen Charakters) Kulturen verglichen werden und welche Rolle Religionskonzepten in diesen Kulturvergleichen zukommt. Es fragt damit nach der Bedeutung der Wahrnehmung von ,orientalischer Religion‘ für die Definition des Eigenen in der russischen Kultur der ersten Hälfte des 19. Jahrhunderts sowie danach, wie Religion in entsprechenden Texten im Vergleich mit verschiedenen anderen Identitätsangeboten (z.B. Wissenschaft, Geschichtsbilder) positioniert ist. In diesem Rahmen ist ausserdem zu fragen, ob in den entsprechenden Texten nicht nur eine distanziert-beschreibende Sichtweise, sondern auch religiöse Perspektiven (ob fasziniert-aneignend oder abwehrend) zu beobachten sind. Den zeitlichen Orientierungsrahmen der Untersuchung bilden die Jahre 1804-1855, die als frühe Phase der akademischen Orientalistik in Russland gelten können. Das zu bearbeitende Quellenkorpus setzt sich aus Texten zusammen, die aus dem Kontext der beiden wichtigsten Zentren der frühen russischen Orientalistik (Kazan’ und St. Petersburg) entstammen sowie aus literarischen Werken und Reiseberichten, die in Situationen des Kulturkontaktes an der südlichen Peripherie des Zarenreiches (Kaukasus und Persien) entstanden sind. Das Projekt geht von drei Fallstudien zu drei einflussreichen Personen aus den beschriebenen Kontexten aus. Untersucht werden einschlägige Texte des Wissenschaftlers, Reisenden, Journalisten und Schriftstellers Osip Senkovskij (1800-1858), des Wissenschaftlers und Reisenden Il’ja Berezin (1818-1896) und des Schriftstellers Aleksandr Bestužev-Marlinskij (1797-1837).

The project includes cases of Northern (Morocco), Western (Ghana), Eastern (Tanzania) and Central Africa (Rwanda). These cases also reflect similarities as well as differences among LSLA configurations as the project discusses cases of direct external investments with and without direct labour involvement of local people (two cases with no involvement, two cases with workers or contract farmers). In addition, we focus on the food status of households in the project areas trying to find answers on the impact LSLA’s have on food security. A mixed methods approach will be used, with a strong focus on qualitative methodology from social anthropology.The project is based on collaboration between the Institute of Social Anthropology and Institute of Geography, University of Bern (Profs. Tobias Haller and Jean-David Gerber) and The Swiss Tropical Public Health Institute in Basel (Dr. Sonja Merten) and the Centre for Gender Studies (Prof. Brigitte Schnegg).Despite the fact that the importance of looking closely at gender relations has been highlighted since the issue of „Land Grabbing“ became important in academia and for NGOs (i.e. Behrmann 2011), there are very few case studies on the issue. In early 2013 FAO published technical guidelines for gender equity in the context of LSLA that aimed to illustrate principles for gender equal participation and communication in land related issues. It highlighted that the focus needs to go beyond narrow gender issues and that governance and institutional issues, including legal state and customary issues (i.e. access and inheritance), need to be analysed. Interestingly however, most studies do not contextualize gender power relations and institutional change enough in this context. This is the gab this research project tries to fill. It shall show first how LSLA impacts existing power constellations governing access to land, including to so-called common pool resources.

Il s’intéressa, en outre, au mélange des niveaux musicaux savant et populaire effectué dans un cadre favorisant la démocratisation de la culture savante.La notion d’identité culturelle définie notamment par la musique est en train de s’établir comme un point central de la réflexion des musicologues, en témoigne le dernier colloque international de la Société Internationale de Musicologie (19th Congress of the Musicological Society, Musics, Cultures, Identites, Rome, 1er-7 juillet 2012). Cette perspective de recherche encore relativement nouvelle - et en totale explosion - est particulièrement pertinente dans le cas d’un pays quadrilingue, comme l’est la Suisse. En effet, les différences de langue induisent des environnements culturels très divers à l’intérieur d’un même pays. Dans le cadre d’une minorité linguistique comme l’est le français en Suisse, l’enjeu est alors à la fois d’affirmer sa langue à l’intérieur du pays, mais également d’établir son identité nationale et, par conséquent, de se distinguer des autres pays francophones, notamment de la France limitrophe. En outre, la Romandie n’est pas homogène du point de vue confessionnel, une particularité contribuant à compliquer la définition de l’identité romande.Le projet se propose d’étudier ce phénomène à un moment-clé de l’histoire de la construction des identités nationales et régionales, la période qui a vu la géographie européenne bouleversée par la Première Guerre mondiale, la radicalisation des nationalismes et le nouveau rôle des masses dans la société (1900-1939). Il étudiera la question sur trois axes parallèles, permettant ainsi de prendre la mesure du phénomène dans diverses couches sociales : -l’étude des manuels scolaires de chant, qui incarnent une politique culturelle adressée  à toutes les couches sociales ; -celle des Fêtes des vignerons de 1905 et 1927, qui permettra de voir comment une fête populaire - réunissant plusieurs milliers d’acteurs amateurs - suscite le même sentiment dans un cadre différent et moins régulier ; -enfin celle de la production du Théâtre du Jorat, qui offrira la possibilité de saisir ce phénomène à l’intérieur des couches bourgeoises de la société - là encore la majorité des acteurs sont des amateurs - et dans un cadre musical en partie différent, plus « savant » que populaire, avec notamment des contributions d’Arthur Honegger, mais aussi concerné par la question de la popularité. Ces trois champs d’étude rendront possible, non seulement une meilleure connaissance d’un phénomène - celui de la construction de l’identité romande au début du XXe siècle grâce à la musique - mais aussi le développement de nouveaux outils méthodologiques, afin de renouveler l’appréhension d’un corpus à ce jour souvent négligé par la critique.",Musicologie et Histoire du théâtre musical Faculté des Lettres Université de Fribourg,Fribourg,503554,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",Switzerland,Not peer-reviewed,Contribution to book (non peer-reviewed),"‘Heureux celui qui revoit sa patrie’ : Gustave Doret, la musique nationale et les mythologies romandes ",VincentDelphine,Published,2018,978-3-0343-3423-5,,,Mythologies romandes : Gustave Doret et la musique nationale,"Peter Lang,Bern",Mythologies romandes : Gustave Doret et la musique nationale,,,9,21,Mythologies romandes : Gustave Doret et la musique nationale,,,156484,"Media relations: print media, online media",A la redécouverte de Gustave Doret ,,2018

The present project aims at filling this gap by extending a new theoretical and empirical framework to achievement goal theory-with a focus on performance goals-that take into account the reasons based on social value that individuals attribute to these goals. In the last thirty years, achievement goal theory has become one of the dominant approaches in the field of achievement motivation. Within this theoretical framework, two main goals are usually described. Mastery goals correspond to the desire to learn, and performance goals to the desire to do better than others. Research has shown that mastery goals are associated with many positive outcomes (e.g., task interest, deep studying, efforts) but hold an inconsistent relationship with academic performance, whereas performance goals lead to many maladaptive outcomes (e.g., low performance, low interest, self-handicapping), but in their approach form, consistently predict academic success (Murayama & Elliot, 2012b; Senko, Hulleman, & Harackiewicz, 2011). These findings have produced numerous recommendations to teachers as to how influence the students’ goals and thereby learning (Meece, Anderman, & Anderman, 2006), but have not questioned whether achievement goals reflect not only actual motivations but also some social constraints imposed by the educational system. Indeed achievement goal theory has often overlooked the social context in which these goals are expressed (Darnon, Dompnier, & Poortvliet, 2012), relying on the assumption that goal measures are the direct translation of individuals’ psychological latent goals or desires.Recent research has challenged this assumption and has demonstrated that (1) students clearly know that achievement goals are socially valued differently at University on the two dimensions of social value (social desirability and social utility), (2) they are able to use this knowledge to produce specific self-images (Darnon, Dompnier, Delmas, Pulfrey, & Butera, 2009), and (3) these perceptions of goals’ social value moderate the relationship between goal endorsement and performance outcomes (Dompnier, Darnon, & Butera, 2009, 2013; Dompnier et al., 2014; Dompnier et al., submitted; Smeding et al., submitted). Specifically, the more students perceive mastery as a means to succeed in their curricula (social utility), the higher these goals’ predictive validity. Conversely, the more students perceive these goals as a means to be appreciated by the teachers (social desirability), the lower these goals’ predictive power. The current project is aimed at completing this accumulated evidence by investigating the impact of social value on performance goals. (1) Two experiments will assess the moderating role of social value on the predictive validity of performance-approach (Study 1) and performance-avoidance goals (Study 2). (2) Three additional experiments will test this moderating role on these two categories of goals from a multiple goal perspective within the framework of the “opposing processes model of competition and performance” (Murayama & Elliot, 2012b). The sample will consist of university students and is not intended to be representative of the general population, but rather to provide insight as to some fundamental motivational processes involved in the moderating effects of students’ knowledge about the social value of performance goals on the link between these constructs and academic performance.",Institut de psychologie Université de Lausanne,Lausanne,552056,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",Switzerland,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),Replicability crisis in social psychology: Looking at the past to find new pathways for the future,"Swiatkowski Wojciech,  Dompnier Benoit",Published,2017,,10.5334/irsp.66,https://www.rips-irsp.com/articles/10.5334/irsp.66/,International Review of Social Psychology,,International Review of Social Psychology,30,,111,124,International Review of Social Psychology,,Over the last few years psychology researchers have become increasingly preoccupied with the question of whether findings from psychological studies are generally replicable. The debates have originated from some unfortunate events of scientific misconduct in the field and they have reached a climax with the recent discovery of a relatively weak rate of replicability of published literature leading to the so called replicability crisis in psychology. The present paper is concerned with examining the issue of replicability in the field of social psychology. We begin by drawing a state of the art of the crisis in this field. We then highlight some possible causes for the crisis discussing topics of statistical power questionable research practices publication standards and hidden auxiliary assumptions of context dependency of social psychological theories. Finally we argue that given the absence of absolute falsification in science social psychology could greatly benefit from adopting McGuire’s perspectivist approach to knowledge construction.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In addition, coordinated interactions between low- (~ 4 Hz - 15 Hz) and high-frequency (> 30 Hz, i.e., gamma range) rhythmic neural activity have been proposed as a possible mechanism for the control and representation of mnemonic contents during wakefulness. During sleep, a fine-tuned interaction between hippocampal memory reactivations, thalamic spindle activity (13 - 15 Hz) and cortical slow oscillations (< 1 Hz) is assumed to underlie the beneficial effect of sleep on memory. A causal role of memory reactivations is supported by studies showing that inducing reactivations during sleep by cueing improves memory formation. However, the oscillatory mechanisms of “successful” memory reactivation during sleep underlying the subsequent strengthening of memory traces by reactivation are currently unknown. In this project we aim at identifying the oscillatory underpinnings of successful memory reactivations during sleep. Similar to previous studies on the “subsequent memory effect” (SME) during wakefulness, we will focus on the oscillatory correlates as well as changes in cross-frequency coupling of the “subsequent memory effect of reactivation” (SME-R) during sleep, i.e. by comparing neural signals during reactivation of subsequently remembered vs. forgotten items. In the planned experiments, we will (a) specify and characterize the oscillatory correlates of SME-R depending on different pre-reactivation microstates (up- vs. down-state of slow oscillation as inferred from surface slow waves) during several sleep macro-states (N3 vs. N2 vs. rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep) and (b) experimental induce different oscillatory patterns after the SME-R period to examine a possible causal role for SME-R related oscillatory activity (slow wave activity, spindle activity, theta activity) for later memory improvements. In addition, we will relate the SME-R during sleep to oscillatory correlates of the SME during learning as well as during retrieval testing. The results of this project will greatly enhance our theoretical understanding of the oscillatory mechanisms underlying successful memory reactivation and strengthening during sleep, and will integrate these processes with current accounts on oscillatory processes involved in memory retention during wakefulness. Furthermore, by possibly identifying that combined induction of an oscillatory pattern + reactivation improves memory consolidation during sleep, the results of this project might also have important clinical implications for patients with memory impairments and/or sleep disorders.",Département de Psychologie Université de Fribourg,Fribourg,554158,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",Germany,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),Re-presentation of Olfactory Exposure Therapy Success Cues during Non-Rapid Eye Movement Sleep did not Increase Therapy Outcome but Increased Sleep Spindles,"Rihm Julia S.,  Sollberger Silja B.,  Soravia Leila M.,  Rasch Björn",Published,2016,,10.3389/fnhum.2016.00340,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00340/full,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,10,,340,,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,,,162388,Talks/events/exhibitions,Cerebral Doping: movie 'Limitless' and open discussion,http://admin.unifr.ch/futura/content/conferences/38709,2018

Son œuvre est devenue synonyme, à la fois, d’humanisme profond et de radicalité esthétique, et c’est en tant que telle qu’elle a marqué des générations d’écrivains et d’artistes du monde entier (Nixon / Feldman, 2009). Il peut paraître d’autant plus étonnant que l’œuvre de jeunesse de l’auteur n’ait que rarement reçu l’attention qu’elle mérite. En effet, c’est seulement ces dernières années, avec la publication de la correspondance de l’auteur (2009 et 2011) et le dépouillement de ses nombreux carnets et manuscrits, que la critique a commencé à prendre la mesure des multiples sources auxquelles cette œuvre s’est à son tour nourrie. Un tel travail s’annonce d’autant plus complexe que Beckett appartient à au moins deux cultures qui structurent son œuvre : une culture anglo-saxonne, à la fois anglaise et irlandaise, et une culture française d’adoption. Tiraillé et inscrit dans deux langues d’écriture, l’anglais et le français, mais aussi dans deux contextes éditoriaux et deux modes de recherche universitaire, Beckett a échappé pendant longtemps à une mise en perspective apte à saisir le caractère non seulement plurilingue, mais essentiellement pluriculturel de son œuvre.  Le présent projet vise à combler cette lacune en étudiant un aspect jusqu’à présent particulièrement négligé de cette œuvre, à savoir son rapport complexe, fait à la fois d’appropriation et de refus, du surréalisme. Car si les biographes de Beckett ont relevé le contact de l’auteur irlandais avec le mouvement français, aucune étude comparative d’envergure entre l’œuvre littéraire de Beckett et la production tant pratique que théorique du mouvement surréaliste n’a été entreprise, alors même que de nombreux documents montrent que Beckett s’est très tôt familiarisé avec cette esthétique (Hunkeler, 2006). Ce projet se basera dans un premier temps sur l’exploitation systématique d’écrits et de documents d’archives qui permettent une relecture de l’œuvre beckettienne à travers le mouvement d’avant-garde français. Ces documents sont, principalement, de deux ordres. Il s’agit d’une part des nombreuses traductions de surréalistes rédigées en anglais par Beckett, qui se découpent en deux périodes bien distinctes dans l’évolution de l’œuvre beckettienne, à savoir la période 1931-32 et l’immédiat après-guerre, et d’autre part de la correspondance et des notes de lecture de l’auteur. Sur cette base, il s’agira d’étudier l’œuvre de Samuel Beckett moins dans la perspective d’une reprise consciente et directe qu’à la lumière d’une productivité du surréalisme, de son projet et de ses expérimentations formelles. En effet, ce sera au moyen d’une recontextualisation socio-historique de Beckett dans le champ littéraire de son époque et d’une appréhension de la genèse de l’œuvre beckettienne, s’attachant à comprendre la prégnance du surréalisme - de ses formes, de son esthétique et de ses théorisations littéraires - que le présent projet cherchera à contribuer à une meilleure compréhension des enjeux pluriculturels dans la littérature moderne et contemporaine.",Domaine Français Département des langues et littératures Université de Fribourg,Fribourg,116717,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Research Infrastructures",Great Britain and Northern Ireland,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Existing studies on lean imple-mentation have mainly investigated its effects on organizational performance. Regarding effects on psychosocial working conditions and employees’ health, empirical evidence is scarce and contradictory (Hasle, Bojesen, Jensen, & Bramming, 2012; Ulhassan, von Thiele Schwarz, Thor, & Westerlund, 2014). Thus, the proposed research project aims to 1) evaluate the impact of implementing a LM under consideration of employees’ health in a healthcare setting on employees’ working conditions, employees’ health, and lean work processes and 2) to identify factors predicting a positive impact on each of these three outcomes.The project builds on data collected in the context of the comprehensive scientific evaluation of a lean imple-mentation project within nursing wards of a Swiss university hospital (University Hospital Zurich [USZ]). LM was implemented as an umbrella strategy in the whole hospital. As a key element, so called Rapid Process Im-provement / Kaizen Workshops (RPIW) were conducted in a standardized way with employee representatives in all nursing wards. During one session of these four-day lean workshops, the employees’ health perspective was introduced. Based on a survey-feedback method, workshop participants developed ward-specific action plans to improve working conditions and health in their own nursing ward.The study applies a wait list control group design with 16 wards assigned to the intervention and 13 wards to the wait list control group. For the longitudinal data collection, a comprehensive, standardized survey instrument with validated scales was applied to all employees in the participating wards, three times with 6 months inter-vals. The average response rate was 58.5% across all wards, resulting in sample sizes above n=500 for each measurement point. Intervention process and context data were collected by written surveys of workshop partici-pants and by four focus groups. Results gained by the proposed research project can be used and applied by other hospitals to adapt and imple-ment lean management in a way that not only optimizes productivity but also employees’ working conditions and health as prerequisites for sustainable performance.","Institut für Epidemiologie, Biostatistik und Prävention Universität Zürich",Zürich,49191,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication;Exchange of personnel",United States of America,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For example, in grapheme-colour synaesthesia a digit (e.g., “5”, referred to as the inducer) may trigger a specific colour experience (e.g., “blue”, referred to as the concurrent). Importantly, the inducer-concurrent pairs are idiosyncratic, but highly consistent, and the experience of the concurrent is typically triggered automatically. Previous research has found that people with synaesthesia show an advantage in a variety of memory tasks, some involving memory for inducer stimuli, but some involving also concurrent stimuli, or even materials not directly related to synaesthesia. So far, most of the research has been limited to grapheme-colour synaesthesia. However, it is possible that, given that any form of synaesthesia provides for a richer world of experiences which may trigger additional spontaneous associations and thus lead to elaborated memory traces and consequently to an advantage in memory retrieval, the memory advantage is not restricted to grapheme-colour synaesthesia.In this project, the goal is to investigate people with grapheme-colour synaesthesia, people with sound-colour synaesthesia, people with both grapheme-colour synaesthesia and sound-colour synaesthesia, and in addition, people with sequence-space synaesthesia and non-synaesthete control group. All participants will be given three episodic memory tests which involve a) words, b) music, and c) colours. This allows to test whether synaesthesia is inducer-specific, domain-specific or even more general. Moreover, as previous research has investigated memory performance only over the short term (typically within one test session), a further goal is to re-test the participants in order to find out whether synaesthesia  in fact leads to better memory over the long-term. Overall, this study will contribute to the understanding of the cognitive consequences of synaesthesia for memory.  In particular, this is the first study to compare the specificity of the memory advantage across different types of synaesthesia, to test whether the presence of multiple forms of synaesthesia lead to additional memory advantages, and whether the memory advantages persist across time.",Institut für Psychologie Universität Bern,Bern,533585,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),Creativity and involvement in art in different types of synaesthesia,"Lunke Katrin,  Meier Beat",Published,2019,,10.1111/bjop.12363,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjop.12363,British Journal of Psychology,,British Journal of Psychology,,,727,744,British Journal of Psychology,,The aim of the present study was to test the relationship between different types of synaesthesia and their involvement in art creative and visual abilities.

We assessed the number of artistic professions involvement in art and the performance in psychometric tests of divergent and convergent creativity as well as visual and visuo spatial abilities. Results show a higher prevalence of artists amongst synaesthetes especially sound colour synaesthetes. Sound colour synaesthetes also showed a higher involvement in artistic activities overall while sequence space synaesthetes showed higher involvement in visual art. Only grapheme colour and sound colour synaesthetes showed significantly higher divergent creativity compared to matched controls. Additionally overall synaesthetes scored higher in visuo spatial abilities (i.e. mental rotation). For synaesthetes and controls visuo spatial abilities correlated with divergent creativity. We discuss that synaesthetes’ higher involvement in art is not necessarily reflected in their basic creative abilities. ,149692,Other activities,Synaesthesia,,2017

Schimank 2007: 10-14; Neuberger 2014: 568), die sich gegenseitig beeinflussen (vgl. Imhof 2006: 1-10). Auf der Mikro- und Meso-Ebene führt dies zu einer Pluralisierung von gesellschaftlichen Interessen (vgl. Jarren et al. 2007: 9). Auf die Differenzierung reagiert auch die Werbung, die ihre Zielgruppen möglichst umfassend und ohne Streuverluste erreichen will und so die Medienunternehmen zu differenzierten Medienangeboten stimuliert (vgl. von Rimscha/Siegert 2015: 64-65). Da dies aufgrund der industriellen Produktionsweise wie auch von politisch wie kulturell etablierten Angebotsformen nicht bei allen traditionellen Massenmedien (so Fernsehen und Tages- und Wochenpresse) umgesetzt werden kann, kommt vor allem dem Zeitschriftenmarkt eine besondere Bedeutung zu. Hier können neue Angebote erprobt und wieder zurückgenommen werden. Vergleichbar mit dem Internet, in dem aber die Nutzer selbst aktiv werden müssen, wird im Zeitschriftenmarkt über das Angebot die Nachfrage zu stimulieren versucht. Differenzierung hat einen stetigen Wandel aufgrund der Interdependenzen zwischen Medien- und Sozialsystemen zur Folge (vgl. Blumler 2002: 171-172; Nowak 2009: 101; Davidson 2012). Durch den Wandel von Mediensystemen ändert sich unter anderem auch deren gesellschaftliche Leistung, was sich wiederum auf die Medienstrukturen auswirkt (vgl. Künzler/Jarren 2009: 577-578; Blumler 2002: 172; Schimank 2005: 40-41). Der Zeitschriftenmarkt kann als Analysefeld für diesen Wandel angesehen werden.Im Forschungsprojekt werden Ausdifferenzierungsprozesse auf der Ebene der Inhalte anhand des Zeitschriftenmarktes analysiert, der sich dafür in mehrfacher Weise anbietet. Erstens sind Wechselwirkungen von struktureller und performativer Ausgestaltung und den zugrundeliegenden Ausdifferenzierungsprozessen in besonderem Masse bei Zeitschriften stark zu beobachten (vgl. Dierks 2009a: 9/11). So suchen bspw. «Anzeigenkunden nach immer stärker profilierten und spezifischeren Zielgruppen [, was] eine Entwicklung steigender Titelzahlen mit entsprechend spezieller Orientierung [nach sich zieht]» (Tschörtner/Schenk 2009: 22) und damit zu einer Ausdifferenzierung von Medienpublika und ggf. auch von Öffentlichkeit führt. Zweitens sind Zeitschriften für die Analyse von Ausdifferenzierungsprozessen sowohl aus inhaltlicher als auch methodischer Sicht geeignet, da sie über eine sehr hohe inhaltliche Heterogenität verfügen, aber im Gegensatz zu Onlinemedien eine retrospektive Untersuchung zulassen. Drittens stellen Zeitschriften in Analysen der Publizistik- und Kommunikationswissenschaft ein Forschungsdesiderat dar (vgl. Lüthy 2013: 7; Seufert 2004: 87).Das Ziel des Projektes besteht darin, Differenzierungsprozesse anhand des Zeitschriftenmarktes in der Schweiz und Deutschland auf drei Analyseebenen exemplarisch zu untersuchen und dadurch eine Forschungslücke zu schliessen: (1) Auf der Ebene der Zeitschriftenangebotsstruktur werden Ein- und Austritte der Zeitschriftenangebote analysiert. (2) Auf der Ebene des thematischen Profils wird die Entwicklung der jeweiligen Subthemen untersucht. (3) Ausgehend von der Annahme einer Komplexitätssteigerung in sozialen Systemen durch Ausdifferenzierungsprozesse wird der Stellenwert des vermittelten wissenschaftlichen Wissens (Inhalte der Medien) einer Analyse unterzogen.

We will follow a three-pronged approach to identify mechanisms that regulate these processes and develop novel therapeutic approaches and compounds that can be used to target brown adipocytes specifically.

Though molecular mechanisms of gradient formation can vary for distinct morphogens, gradient formation is generally thought to involve a local source of the morphogen, diffusion from this source and degradation. However, in vivo, the specific gradient shapes are likely modulated by a large number of binding partners and reactions, which makes it difficult to dissect the fundamental principles of gradient formation and gradient shape modulation.In this collaborative research proposal, we aim to reconstitute gradients in vitro from a minimal number of components, to dissect the fundamental principles of concentration gradient formation. Our model system is the Pom1 gradient. The kinase Pom1 forms membrane-associated concentration gradients from the cell poles of the fission yeast cell, which serve to control cell division spatially and temporally. Gradient formation relies on a phosphatase 1 complex, delivered to cell poles by microtubules. Dephosphorylation of Pom1 reveals a lipid-binding domain, allowing Pom1 to bind the membrane. At the membrane, Pom1 diffuses laterally and also forms clusters of various sizes, which modulate Pom1 mobility. Pom1 then auto-phosphorylates, which drives its detachment from the membrane. We will combine top-down and bottom-up approaches to define the basic principles governing the formation of Pom1 gradients and regulating its specific shape. Our proposal has three specific aims:Aim 1: To define the mode of Pom1 membrane binding We will study how Pom1 binds the membrane, defining specific lipid requirements in vivo and in vitro. We will dissect the contribution of auto-phosphorylation in regulating membrane affinity and gradient shape. Aim 2: To describe Pom1 gradient shape and the properties of Pom1 clusters We will use super-resolution imaging technology (PALM), as well as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) to probe the distribution of Pom1, in particular in its cluster forms, and obtain diffusion and detachment rates. Particular attention will be paid to how cluster formation may modulate these parameters. In vivo and in vitro interaction studies and structure-function analyses will help define the mechanism of cluster formation. We will also define the role of the membrane and of microtubules in Pom1 clustering.Aim 3: To define a minimal system for Pom1 gradients and reconstitute them in vitro  Four components are thought to be minimally required to generate a Pom1 gradient, namely active Pom1, a lipid membrane, a phosphatase and a means to control the location of this phosphatase at the membrane. We will test the sufficiency of these elements in vivo by reconstituting Pom1 gradients in a heterologous cell. This minimal set of components will then be used to reconstitute Pom1 gradients in vitro. We will first use 2D bilayer systems with an immobilized phosphatase source to form Pom1 gradients. We will then reconstitute the Pom1 gradient with both the geometry of fission yeast cells and microtubule-mediated delivery of the phosphatase within aqueous droplets surrounded by a lipid monolayer. Results obtained from the reconstitution experiments will be compared to the in vivo situation, using both wildtype and mutant alleles of Pom1 modulating its auto-phosphorylation or clustering properties, which will define how real-life complexities modulate gradient shape and dynamics. Results will be presented in national and international meetings and published in high-profile academic journals.",Département de Microbiologie Fondamentale Faculté de Biologie et de Médecine Université de Lausanne,Lausanne,102018,0000-0002-5317-2557,NA,NA,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),Multi-phosphorylation reaction and clustering tune Pom1 gradient mid-cell levels according to cell size,"Gerganova Veneta,  Floderer Charlotte,  Archetti Anna,  Michon Laetitia,  Carlini Lina,  Reichler Thais,  Manley Suliana,  Martin Sophie G",Published,2019,,10.7554/elife.45983,http://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.45983,eLife,,eLife,8,,e45983,,eLife,,Protein concentration gradients pattern developing organisms and single cells. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe rod shaped cells Pom1 kinase forms gradients with maxima at cell poles. Pom1 controls the timing of mitotic entry by inhibiting Cdr2 which forms stable membrane associated nodes at mid cell. Pom1 gradients rely on membrane association regulated by a phosphorylation dephosphorylation cycle and lateral diffusion modulated by clustering. Using quantitative PALM imaging we find individual Pom1 molecules bind the membrane too transiently to diffuse from pole to mid cell. Instead we propose they exchange within longer lived clusters forming the functional gradient unit. An allelic series blocking auto phosphorylation shows that multi phosphorylation shapes and buffers the gradient to control mid cell levels which represent the critical Cdr2 regulating pool. TIRF imaging of this cortical pool demonstrates more Pom1 overlaps with Cdr2 in short than long cells consistent with Pom1 inhibition of Cdr2 decreasing with cell growth. Thus the gradients modulate Pom1 mid cell levels according to cell size.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The pathomechanism of IPF remains incompletely understood, but repetitive injuries of the alveolar epithelium have been suggested to provoke disturbed wound healing with delayed re-epithelialization. These processes induce an expansion of mesenchymal cells and their enhanced deposition of extracellular matrix proteins in the lung interstitium, finally leading to progressive fibrosis (Selman, King et al. 2001). Considering the so far limited effect of anti-fibrotic treatments, new therapeutic approaches might focus on the alveolar epithelium and its injury repair capacities. Recently we have demonstrated the presence of multipotent bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in the lung parenchyma of patients with IPF (Gazdhar, Susuri et al. 2013). These cells secreted hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a pleiotropic growth factor with anti-fibrotic properties via the induction of lung epithelial cell proliferation, thereby improving epithelial wound repair (Kim, Sammak et al. 1999; Chakraborty, Chopra et al. 2013). Furthermore, we could demonstrate that HGF-over expressing-bone marrow derived stromal cells attenuated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in the rat lung (Gazdhar, Susuri et al. 2013). Using multipotent MSC grown from lung tissue obtained from patients with IPF we could show that these cells exerted significant anti-fibrotic effects in vitro (Hostettler, Gazdhar et al. 2014). Translating into clinical medicine, we could demonstrate increased numbers of these multipotent MSC in lung tissue from patients with fibrotic lung diseases compared to emphysema lungs (Hostettler, Gazdhar et al. 2014). Objectives: The objectives of this project are to further investigate the role of autologous MSC in the pathogenesis of IPF and to study possible strategies involving the use of autologous MSC and their products for future treatments in IPF patients. Methods: This project is based on the in vitro culture of primary human MSC obtained from patients with IPF and on the already established bleomycin animal model. (i) [Basel] Lung tissue and broncho alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from IPF patients and from patients with non-IPF idiopathic interstitial lung diseases will be collected. Primary cultures of MSC will be established and the effect of secreted mediators of MSC on extracellular matrix (ECM) secretion/metabolization by primary human lung fibroblasts will be studied. Comparisons of the amount of MSC in BAL fluid with clinical patient data such as lung volumes and course of disease will be undertaken. (ii) [Bern] Using the bleomycin rat model, the mechanism of recruitment and homing of the MSC to the site of fibrosis will be investigated. The effect of over expression of HGF and stromal derived growth factor (SDF-1) in the lung on homing and engraftment of MSC will be studied. The effect of instilled human MSC and its secreted mediators into animals (RNU rats) on bleomycin-induced fibrosis will be investigated. (iii) [St.Gallen] Gene expression profiles will be gained from MSC isolated from patients with IPF and from patients with non-IPF idiopathic interstitial lung diseases using an oligonucleotide array platform. Gene expression signatures will be analyzed for correlation with diagnosis, histology, and clinical parameters. Gene expression will also be performed for the rat lungs treated with MSC and secreted mediators and lungs over expressing SDF-1 and HGF. (iv) [Hannover] To thoroughly localize MSC in different compartments in IPF and in bleomycin-treated animal lungs correlative imaging from macro to ultrastructural level will be performed. By means of quantitative microscopy the numbers of MCS will be determined and correlated to the degree of injury to the alveolar epithelial lining and structural abnormalities. Expected impact: This project will broaden the knowledge regarding the origin, behavior and potential of autologous MSC and their products with regard to the pathomechanism and treatment of IPF and will enable a translational approach to present novel stem cells based therapeutic options for patients with IPF.",Universitätsklinik für Pneumologie Inselspital,Bern,126791,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",United States of America,Peer-reviewed,,Digital 3D reconstructions using histological serial sections of lung tissue including the alveolar capillary network,"Grothausmann Roman,  Knudsen Lars,  Ochs Matthias,  Mühlfeld Christian",Published,2017,,10.1152/ajplung.00326.2016,,American Journal of Physiology-Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology,,American Journal of Physiology-Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology,312,2,L243,L257,American Journal of Physiology-Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology,,,160704,"Media relations: radio, television",REduktion von Tierversuchen,,2017

Recent studies suggest that HDLs help to maintain euglycemia via both insulin-dependent and -independent pathways. In vitro and animal experiments provided evidence that HDL improves the function and survival of beta cells as well as glucose lowering metabolism in muscle, liver and adipose tissue. However, the identity of the agonists and their cognate receptors as well as the elicited signaling pathways and downstream targets of the anti-diabetogenic HDL activities are yet poorly resolved.The present project aims to identify and characterize the signaling mechanisms used by HDLs to protect beta cells from apoptosis by using three complementary approaches. In the first approach, Prof. Widmann will rely on an unbiased siRNA whole genome screen and on kinase activity profiling to identify proteins mediating the anti-apoptotic function of HDLs, in particular in the context of noxious stimuli inducing ER stress. The second approach spearheaded by Prof. von Eckardstein will focus on the biochemical identification of anti-apoptotic components either carried or released by HDLs. The third approach followed by Prof. Regazzi will be to characterize the non-coding RNAs (e.g. miRNA, long non-coding RNAs, etc.) that regulate the protective functions of HDLs. Anti-apoptotic HDL components will be tested for their ability to regulate the proteins identified in the siRNA screen. Information obtained from these three approaches will be combined to define the pro-survival signaling receptors and pathway of HDLs in beta cells. Understanding the protective pathways activated by HDLs in beta cells is a pre-requisite for the development of drugs that stimulate or mimic the anti-diabetic effects of HDLs and thereby help to lower the risk, for example in overweight patients, to manifest type 2 diabetes mellitus.",Département de Physiologie Faculté de Biologie et de Médecine Université de Lausanne,Lausanne,66426,0000-0002-6881-0363,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results",Switzerland,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Both biological and epidemiological studies suggest a direct link between the two phenomena:  rodent studies show that metabolic pathways influence daily “circadian” timing, and epidemiological studies suggest that disrupted daily rhythms correlate with both obesity and diabetes. However, the genetic and biochemical links between circadian clocks and metabolic disorders remain entirely unknown in humans.Preliminary data from the group of E. Dermitzakis (UniGe) suggest that a sizable portion of risk for metabolic diseases that can be genetically attributed in humans are due to effects on gene regulation and transcription.  Preliminary data from the teams of S. Brown (UZH) and J. Philippe (HUG) have shown that human circadian clock properties can be measured in vitro in simple fibroblasts, and that a relationship exists between clock properties measured in vitro and in vivo, and diabetic parameters in the same subjects.  In this application, we plan to link and expand these results to provide a comprehensive picture of the human cellular mechanisms connecting circadian clock variance with the risk of metabolic disease.To do so, we shall use a combined approach of human genetics, in vitro cellular analyses, and circadian metabolomics in a longitudinal cohort of diabetic and obese individuals, and healthy matched controls.  In Experiment I, fibroblasts and serum will be taken from these individuals at a single timepoint (Group Philippe), and the resulting circadian parameters (measured in fibroblasts) and metabolic parameters (measured in serum, Groups Brown and Philippe) will be used for eQTL analysis (Group Dermitzakis) to identify molecular pathways that connect the circadian clock to human metabolism, and that are dysregulated in metabolic disease.  In Experiment II, ten individuals from each group will undergo blood metabolomics and transcriptomic characterization during 24 hours.  This further characterization will explore how the pathways identified in Experiment I vary with time of day, and how this oscillation is changed during metabolic disease. The study that we propose would provide significant tangible benefits, both to the circadian and metabolic fields, in basic research and medicine. For the first time, our study will link common circadian clock variation in humans to the susceptibility of debilitating metabolic disease, and through the power of human genomics and metabolomics propose specific cellular mechanisms for this relationship. Secondly, the interns that we train will benefit from a cross-disciplinary education during which each becomes familiar with the different experimental measures conducted in the three laboratories. Finally, although the timeframe of this grant precludes meaningful longitudinal study, our cohort will be created with this goal in mind. The creation of a longitudinal cohort characterized in detail at a molecular level provides an ideal resource for later investigations by our laboratories and others.

Recent studies provide compelling evidence that membraneless compartmentalization can be achieved by liquid demixing a process culminating in liquid liquid phase separation and the formation of phase boundaries.

On a global scale today’s biomass burning emissions contribute roughly 50% of those from fossil fuel combustion. However, the most important drivers for the long-term biomass burning trend are still largely debated. During the last 150 years a decoupling of fire activity from the main drivers temperature and population density was suggested, because of its typical shape the reconstructed fire activity pattern was denominated “broken” fire hockey stick. The decoupling between fire and climate is in agreement with increases in landscape fragmentation, but is not supported by other data such as methane concentrations, implying that the underlying processes are not fully understood. This lack of understanding in combination with the worldwide occurrence of devastating wildfires in the past decades raises major concerns about the capacity to manage fire under future climate change scenarios. The project “Paleo fires from high-alpine ice cores” (further referred to as Paleo fires) is an integrated research frame work aiming to test the hypothesis of the “broken” fire hockey stick. The overall objective is to significantly advance the understanding of complex systemic linkages between climate, land use, fire and vegetation for different regions over the most recent period of the last 150 years in comparison to the previous 2000 years. The approach of Paleo fires is to establish regional paleo fire histories from multi-proxy high-alpine ice core records in the four geographical areas of Central Europe, Southern Siberia, tropical Amazonia, and the Arctic, using Black Carbon (BC) and charcoal as fire tracers. The atmospheric footprint of the ice cores in terms of the different sources contributing to BC and charcoal will be determined using back tra-jectories and global modelling of biomass burning relevant tracers to better understand the representativeness of the individual proxies. Quantitative transfer functions will be developed through identification of single fire events and their corresponding burned area from satellite data in combination with air mass trajectories.Paleo fires will be based on analyses of existing high-alpine ice cores with a good, controlled chronology particularly for the time period AD1850 to present, allowing linking modern ice core data directly with coincide observations from satellites. This is a major advantage compared to previous fire records, which are partly undated and usually have multi-decadal resolutions only.

In contrast to current approaches our targeting motifs will derive from libraries of modular small molecule macrocyclic scaffolds, opening the door to a variety of previously inaccessible targets. Our guided drugs will be designed to be released at the target through the development of smart linkers that respond to a disease microenvironment or cell receptor. The drugs themselves will derive from known compounds complemented by designs created in the Schneider group. Many pharmaceutical agents are unselective, causing toxicity to normal organs and preventing dose escalation to therapeutically active regimens. Selectively delivering and activating drugs at the site of disease holds great promise for dramatically increasing the therapeutic index of bioactive molecules, thus providing substantial benefits to patients. A successful general platform that exploits small ligands for pharmacodelivery applications would represent a transformative innovation for both academia and industry.Current strategies for targeted drug delivery rely mainly on antibodies as “vehicles”, but recent disappointments in Phase III clinical trials (>5 high-profile clinical failures) with antibody-drug conjugates call into question their real value. Moreover, because of their large size and unacceptably high cost, antibodies can only be used for delivering ultra-potent drugs, hindering development opportunities with conventional pharmaceutical agents and in areas outside oncology. A handful of naturally-occurring small organic ligands for common receptors (folate receptor, carbonic anhydrase IX) have been proposed as an alternative to antibodies for pharmacodelivery strategies, but a general approach that avoids large biomolecules has not been described due to limitations in ligand discovery and to the lack of suitable strategies for drug release at the site of disease. The ability to create “smart drugs” will emerge from advances made in each of the subgroups: Specifically, we will construct encoded chemical libraries of unprecedented size and quality (dozens of millions of compounds) and screen these libraries for ligands against at least ten validated accessible markers of cancer and chronic inflammation. In addition, we will develop and implement innovative technologies for the smart release and activation of bioactive payloads at the site of disease. The linker/release triggers for therapeutic payloads will be tailored to respond to the disease microenvironment and to selectively act on the target cells of choice. In addition to employing well-known cytotoxic agents like tubulin inhibitors (DM1, MMAE) as payloads, we will primarily explore the use of membrane-disruptive peptides. These designed cytotoxic peptides have the unique advantage of (i) directly addressing the plasma membrane of cancer cells as target without the involvement of proteins, which minimizes the risk of cancer cell escape by mutation or development of resistances; (ii) cancer cell-selective membrane targeting as a result of our molecular design aiming at custom-tailored highly potent cytotoxic peptide payloads; and (iii) rapid plasma clearance so that the peptides, once released from the carrier, will act only locally at the site of release, thereby minimizing unwanted off-target and side-effects.The proposal is bold, requiring expertise in chemical, biochemical, and computational technology - a combination beyond the reach of any one research group. The synergy created through the participation of three complementary teams is essential. Prof. Neri (ETH Zürich) will be responsible for the production of target proteins, for the construction and screening of DNA-encoded libraries of chemically-modified cyclic peptides, for the development of small molecule-drug conjugates and for in vivo testing of the most promising compounds in mouse models of cancer and of rheumatoid arthritis.

Here we have compared the tumor targeting properties drug release rates and therapeutic performance of two ADCs based on the maytansinoid DM1 thiol drug and on the F8 antibody directed against the alternatively spliced Extra Domain A (EDA) domain of fibronectin. The antibody was used in IgG or in small immune protein (SIP) format. In both cases DM1 was coupled to unpaired cysteine residues resulting in a drug antibody ratio of 2. In biodistribution studies SIP(F8) SS DM1 accumulated in the tumor and cleared from circulation more rapidly than IgG(F8) SS DM1. However the ADC based on the IgG format exhibited a higher tumor uptake at later time points (e.g. 33IA/g against 8IA/g at 24 hours after intravenous administration). In mouse plasma surprisingly the ADC products in IgG format were substantially more stable compared with the SIP format (half lives >48 hours and <3 hours at 37°C respectively) revealing a novel mechanism for the control of disulfide based drug release rates. Therapy experiments in immunocompetent mice bearing murine F9 tumors revealed that SIP(F8) SS DM1 was more efficacious than IgG(F8) SS DM1 when the two products were compared either in an equimolar basis or at equal milligram doses.  ,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This includes ubiquitous flat-panels displays, solar cells, x-ray detectors. This trend demands a rapid development of new Transparent Conductive Oxide (TCOs) materials (which are used as transparent electrode in most optoelectronic devices) with not only the basic requirements of transparency and conductivity, but also properties like homogeneity (e.g to avoid grain boundaries when used in transistors) and mechanical robustness or flexibility when used in bendable devices. The extensive application of TCOs also requires the use of earth-abundant materials for their production, and therefore the replacement of, for example the rather rare metal indium (In).With the ultimate goal of designing and discovering new TCO materials, this collaborative project aims at bridging the gap between material processing, material simulation and material characterization, to understand the factors affecting the charge transport in disordered or “amorphous” TCOs. This will make possible the design and synthesize of new earth-abundant TCO materials with superior electrical, optical and mechanical properties. Disordered TCO materials are of great interest because of their ease of fabrication, and because of the variety of composition and atomic structure achieved ranging from quasi-polycrystalline to fully amorphous. However, disordered TCO materials are complex systems and, their electronic properties cannot be fully understood from sole experimental methods or material simulations, slowing down the development of new materials. To address this problem, we combine three strongly complementary fields in material science research, one theoretical (structural and electronic properties modeling) and two experimental ones (thin-film growth and nano-scale microscopy). The goal is to unravel the missing link between measured and simulated microstructural and electronic properties, to understand the factors affecting electron transport in disordered TCOs. This will be done by local nano-scale characterization of microstructure using unique ex and in situ advanced electron microscopy techniques; material structure and electronic properties prediction using high-end modeling algorythms; and material synthesis using superior thin-film TCO fabrication facilities. The gathered knowledge will be exploited to propose novel TCO coating processes allowing the design of new earth-abundant TCO materials with optimized electrical and optical properties. Due to the complex structure of disordered materials, both experimental and numerical studies will be highly challenging, but the complementary nature of the techniques constitutes the originality and strength of this project.

The classical fluid mosaic model of a membrane, in which hydrophobic integral components such as lipids and membrane proteins are constrained within the plane of the membrane, but are free to diffuse laterally, has been constantly refined, and knowledge and understanding of the structure, function and dynamics of various membrane subsystems is now available at atomic resolution. Whereas production of well-diffracting crystals of membrane protein was considered the most difficult hurdle in molecular membrane biology only two decades ago, conceptual and technological advances in recent years have resulted in a remarkable increase of available high resolution structures of membrane proteins and their complexes, with a concomitant deeper understanding of their function, dynamics and assembly. Among those advances, the concept of utilizing the distinct structural and dynamic material properties of lipidic cubic phases (LCPs) for the solubilization, stabilization and crystallization of membrane proteins, which was introduced by the UZH co-applicant of this proposal yielded about 10% of all membrane protein structures currently available, and all but one of the structures of the pharmacologically important G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Intriguingly, this significant achievement was accomplished using but a few related monoacylglycerols whose chemical structure and function, as well as the ensuing phase behavior, are very similar. Moreover, despite the increased importance of LCPs in membrane studies, the molecular mechanisms underlying LCP-based crystallization, and the underlying molecular interactions between lipids and proteins in such mesophases, are still unclear.Progress in fundamental as well as applied aspects of membrane biology and biophysics thus calls for the design, synthesis and characterization of novel lipids and the judicious use of ensuing lipidic nanomaterials. Advances in this area, which lies at the interface between biophysical chemistry, soft condensed matter physics and technology, and surface and colloidal chemistry, will best be facilitated by an interdisciplinary approach. The current application brings together experts in the fields of lipid design and synthesis, membrane structural biology, soft condensed matter physics, drug delivery, electrochemistry, and surface chemistry, who are committed to address a number of inter-related issues. These include the mechanisms of membrane protein reconstitution, orientation and crystallization within lipidic mesophases; fundamental aspects of transport and dynamics in mesophases, which will lead to applications in drug delivery; and novel stimuli-responsive mesoscopic matrices.Elucidating these fundamental issues will enhance our understanding of the complex structural and dynamic interactions between membrane proteins and lipids within mesoscopic biomaterials, and may have relevance in biomedical science and technology, pharmaceutical science and even food technology.",Institut für Chemie Universität Zürich,Zürich,44824,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication;Research Infrastructures;Exchange of personnel",Poland,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However cities also contain green spaces, which provide habitats for fauna and flora, and ecosystem services, such as food production and wellbeing from contact with nature. The Action Plan of the Swiss Biodiversity Strategy in urban environments has nominated multi-functionality of green spaces among the major concepts, which suggests that urban gardens should perform both ecological and social functions. Despite increasing recognition of its social and ecological importance, and the considerable proportion of urban land under cultivation, there has been insufficient study of urban gardens. Consequently, the relationships between urban gardens and both the well-being of residents and the provision of habitats and corridors for plants and animals are new and important fields in which knowledge gaps exist. Despite the importance of urban green spaces, they are under threat in many Swiss cities, as well as in most European urbanized areas, as cities become denser and green spaces become attractive targets for development. New strategies are needed to strengthen arguments for the preservation of urban green spaces, which should include how to maintain or enhance the sustainability of green space management so that biodiversity and soil quality are secured. The main goal of this study is to contribute to development of these strategies by examining the policy driven and intrinsic motivations of producers to adopt particular production concepts, such as organic and conventional; and productivity oriented and minimum maintenance; in three different urban production types: allotment gardens, private gardens, and alternative gardens. Furthermore, the social value, along with the biodiversity and soil quality, with particular attention to the island character of gardens, will be evaluated and cross-referenced with the various production concepts. The lead question for this study is: What are the social, ecological and soil sustainability impacts of the cultivation of urban gardens under various management concepts in Swiss cities? The research plan will consist of four interlinked subprojects that will examine: a) the motivations for choosing particular production concepts; b) the social value of, attitudes towards, and aesthetic assessment of urban gardens; c) the impacts of production strategies on soil quality; and d) above-and-below ground biodiversity and ecosystem services. This will call for a multiple ecosystem services framework that addresses potential synergies and trade-offs between services and dis-services, and which will be developed within the synthesis of the overall project. While the project is essentially transdisciplinary, an initial hearing phase with policy makers and city administrators was conducted prior to preparation of this proposal to ensure relevance and alignment with the Swiss biodiversity strategy, and thereby enhance the implementation of results. Regarding the practical implementation, the gained understanding of the relationship between soil quality and above ground biodiversity, paying particular attention to the overlap between soil and garden management practices, will allow the formulation of ‘best practice’ methods for sustainable soil management and for above ground biodiversity. For the first time, there will be an assessment of the social and ecological value of urban private and allotment gardens, which can contribute to sensitising the population to the value of threatened urban gardens. Knowledge and awareness gaps with regard to social and ecological ecosystem services will be identified, which will allow the formulation of targeted education strategies to inform the public of the value of these spaces.

Il s’agit d’un effort original et cohérent destiné à la fois à offrir une meilleure connaissance des théories du sens et des formes au XVIIIème siècle, mais aussi d’une tentative militante pour rappeler que le XVIIIème siècle compte parmi les grands siècles de la compréhension. Cette thèse n’est pas partagée par tous - d’aucuns voudraient que la Renaissance ait été l’âge de l’interprétation, le XVIIème et le XVIIIème siècles, les siècles de la représentation, le XIXème siècle enfin celui de l’herméneutique comme discipline - c’est un peu la thèse de Michel Foucault dans Les Mots et les choses ; c’est celle des grands théoriciens de l’herméneutique (pensons à H.G. Gadamer). Mais, c’est s’interdire de comprendre comment le siècle de la critique fut un grand siècle herméneute : qu’il s’agisse de défendre une autre interprétation de la nature (c’est le titre d’un texte de Diderot), des textes, de la Bible (de Bayle à Diderot), des Lois (Montesquieu), des formes picturales ou musicales (Diderot encore),  du théâtre (Voltaire) ou de la pensée elle-même (Rousseau, Kant). Nous essaierons ainsi de comprendre les Lumières à partir de ce que les Lumières ont compris de la compréhension. Par cet effort réflexif nous entendons certes contribuer à repenser l’historiographie des Lumières, mais nous faisons aussi le pari de leur unité et de leur actualité imprévue. De leur unité puisque nous entreprendrons de comprendre les Lumières et leurs théories de la compréhension à partir de l’histoire des théories de l’interprétation, des pratiques de l’édition, de la considération des arts (en premier lieu la musique) et de l’histoire de la philosophie. De leur actualité imprévue, puisque nous entendons offrir à partir de cette interprétation des Lumières une réflexion sur l’archéologie des sciences humaines. L’herméneutique des Lumières n’aura cessé d’interroger les rapports entre les sciences de la nature et les théories de la nature humaine - c’est ici que se situe l’héritage épistémologique des Lumières et que leurs questions sont aussi les nôtres. Il s’agit donc de soutenir que les Lumières eurent une conception plus large de la compréhension des phénomènes humains que la simple application de modèles rationalistes. Notre pari est le suivant : on ne peut comprendre l’héritage théorique, politique et esthétique des Lumières qu’à la condition de s’approcher de la manière dont elles ont compris ce que c’était que comprendre. Comprendre les Lumières, c’est nous comprendre : comprendre la manière que les Lumières eurent de se comprendre, c’est comprendre comment nous nous comprenons à partir d’elles pour revendiquer la modernité de nos sociétés, de nos mœurs, de nos régimes et de nos œuvres. Ce double effort fait l’unité de notre projet au travers de ses différentes déclinaisons : éditer (François Jacob, directeur de l’Institut et Musée Voltaire), interpréter (prof. Martin Rueff, requérant principal, Faculté des Lettres), lire (professoressa Mariafranca Spallanzani, université de Bologne), entendre (prof. Brenno Boccadoro, Faculté des Lettres). Chaque sous-projet posera aux Lumières la question qu’elles se posèrent.  On édite les Lumières ? Comment ont-elles compris le geste éditorial ? (Groupe A). Comment les Lumières ont-elles compris ce que nous essayons de comprendre à travers elles ? (Groupe B). On veut comprendre leur rationalisme ? leur théorie des facultés ? Comment la philosophie des 19ème et 20ème siècles s’est-elle définie à partir de l’auto-compréhension des philosophes ? (Groupe C). On veut comprendre leur théorie musicale ? Comment ont-elles compris l’exégèse musicale, alors qu’elles ont inventé la critique musicale ? (Groupe D). Si notre projet est résolument interdisciplinaire, il faut noter qu’il s’appuie sur des spécialistes de littérature, de philosophie et de musicologie. C’est parce que l’Herméneutique des Lumières est une nouvelle doctrine du sens et en particulier du sens des formes que ces spécialisations sont requises plus que d’autres.

However, under the influence of the ongoing ’cultural turn’ and the new interest in ‘space’ in the social sciences, the socio-cultural micro-space of the house and domestic relations in a wider sense need to be revisited with fresh perspectives. Hence, the objective of the proposed sinergia-project is to rethink and reshape the categories of ‘house’ and ‘family’ which are commonly used in a successive order for traditional and modern societies in Europe. Accordingly, well-known concepts and topoi - if not myths - such as the clear-cut dichotomy of public vs. private, the emergence of separate spheres of men and women and the transformation from an early modern open, socially heterogeneous ‘household-family’ to a modern closed, homogeneous ‘nuclear family’ will be revised in the light of new evidence and with new historical approaches, namely: material culture, social space, knowledge, as well as communication and emotion. The main focus of the entire project lies on continuities and changes in gendered domestic practices in the period of transition ca. 1700-1850 (‘Sattelzeit’, R. Koselleck) with the emphasis on Switzerland. To come up with an appropriate understanding of the socio-cultural micro-space of house and family, it is not enough to concentrate on the domestic sphere alone. It is essential to consider the interactions between the members of the households and families and their changing social and cultural environments, as has been recently underlined in the concept of ‘the open house’ (J. Eibach). The related issues will be analysed in three closely connected subprojects: A: Material culture and consumption; B: Social space and conflict; C: Knowledge production and communication. Each subproject will encompass three individual projects.To create a synergetic surplus of applied methods, the proposed project will foster a set of classical and new methods, especially quantitative analysis of medium-term developments and qualitative thick description, thus combining the investigation of serial records and ego-documents. With regard to the social environments of house and family, network and correspondence analysis will also be helpful, as will discourse analysis in some individual projects. Overarching questions on macro developments will have to be tackled with micro perspectives. Due to the location of Switzerland in central Europe, and because it is a country with several languages and strong regional traditions, Swiss history is very appropriate for the application of comparative perspectives. On the basis of extraordinary source material, so far mostly never used for research, the project team wishes to make a comprehensive contribution to the history of house, family and privacy in Switzerland during a decisive phase of transformation, thereby transcending rural/urban and regional/cantonal borderlines.The project will enable junior researchers (eight doctoral students and one postdoc) to write a dissertation or habilitation, all of which will be closely interlinked by overarching questions and joint perspectives.

Therefore, influenza epidemics are associated with substantial health-care costs, and considerable morbidity and mortality. At highest risk for adverse clinical outcomes are the young/elderly, and patients with chronic diseases or undergoing prolonged immunosuppression. Understanding the factors associated with transmission is a crucial element of improving current preventive strategies. The transmission events in the microenvironment of a population are highly complex. Influenza transmission is dependent on (a) ecological factors such as age distribution, density of schools, population density, and vaccine uptake rate; (b) viral factors such as strain characteristics and fitness; and (c) host factors such as the virus-induced immunity, which applies a potent selection pressure on viral replication. During influenza replication, the viral genome will acquire minor genetic alterations. Transmission of these strains drives continuous and rapid viral evolution in a community during each season. Nowadays, technologies allow rapid sequencing of the whole viral genome and determination of single nucleotide polymorphisms. This high-resolution analysis can be utilized to follow patient-to-patient transmission. For the influenza epidemics, the impact of factors (a-c) on transmission and viral genome evolution is not well described. Further, forecasting the evolution is difficult as illustrated by vaccines failing to protect against the predominant viral strains in circulation. Here, we propose a highly interdisciplinary analysis employing novel techniques from molecular epidemiology and geography with system biological tools that allow: (i) the exploration of the important drivers associated with influenza transmission, particularly with regard to age profiles and population density; and (ii) the analysis of the genetic evolution of circulating influenza lineages over time in selected areas of the city of Basel. We aim to devise novel algorithms capable of forecasting epidemic spread using real-time acquired data during a seasonal epidemic using insight obtained in (i) and (ii). This proposal builds upon the following key results of our work: (a) Comprehensive expertise in urban geography, (b) an extensive network for influenza diagnostics including “next generation sequencing” technologies, allowing the capture of influenza strains and analysis of isolates at a whole genome level; and (c) a recently developed temporal evolutionary model of influenza virus. The interdisciplinary project will expand on influenza data acquired from previous years, existing population data (e.g. population density), and established laboratory and computational techniques. We plan to acquire further epidemiological data (Urban Geography, University Basel). From prospective patient cohorts (University Hospital Basel, Paediatric University Hospital, and Centre of primary health care) we will conduct whole genome virus analysis using “next generation sequencing” (Clinical Microbiology, University Hospital Basel).

Recently, my collaborators and I demonstrated similar priming of defense responses in tall goldenrod, Solidago altissima, by the putative sex pheromone of a closely associated insect herbivore, the specialist gall-inducing fly Eurosta solidaginis. This finding represents the first, and currently only, example of plant response to an animal-derived olfactory cue. The discovery that some plants can eavesdrop on the pheromonal signals of their insect antagonists has potentially wide-ranging implications for the ecology and evolution of plant-insect interactions, as well as for our emerging understanding of plant olfaction. Furthermore, this discovery has potential applied significance, as many herbivorous pests of agricultural and forest ecosystems communicate via pheromones produced in proximity to the plants on which they later feed, and management tactics involving the release of large quantities of synthetic pheromones to disrupt insect mating are in widespread use.The goal of the research proposed here is to build on our previous findings by further elucidating the role of the E. solidaginis volatile emission as a cue priming plant defense responses as well as its presumed function in conspecific signaling between male and female flies. To achieve this goal, I propose five specific objectives, including (i) to more fully characterize the responses of S. altissima plants to the volatile emissions of E. solidaginis by documenting the effects of individual blend components, the levels of exposure required to elicit such effects, and the time span over which priming effects persist; (ii) to document the effects of exposure to herbivore-induced plant volatiles on defense priming in S. altissima in order to exploit the unique opportunity that this study system provides to compare plant responses to two distinct classes of olfactory cues; (iii) to explore mechanisms underlying effects of the E. solidaginis emission on defense priming and induction in S. altissima via analyses of phytohormone profiles and gene expression patterns; (iv) to explore variation in plant responses to the E. solidaginis emission among several additional Solidago species that exhibit varying degrees of association with the fly, as well as among S. altissima genotypes that differ in their susceptibility to galling; and (v) to investigate the role of the E. solidaginis emission in the reproductive ecology of the fly by determining which blend components function in conspecific signaling (and whether they are the same as those which prime plant defenses), as well as whether and how the male emissions mediate female choice and/or correlate with male quality and reproductive success.

As well as this apparent circularity, modeling simplifications at each step affect the accuracy of MSA and phylogeny estimation.  Ideally, phylogeny and alignment should be inferred jointly. Several joint alignment-tree inference (JATI) algorithms were implemented in the Bayesian framework, relying on the classic evolutionary model TKF91 that describes sequence changes (substitutions and indels) by an infinite-state continuous-time birth-death process. These implementations are useful for relatively small datasets, but are not realistic for large modern-day NGS data due to computational limitations, namely the exponential complexity of the TKF91 and the intensive MCMC sampling of multiple parameters including unconventional parameters such as alignment and tree.We propose to develop a fast and accurate JATI algorithm in the frequentist framework, which will be implemented in a user-friendly software package and applicable to large genomic and metagenomic datasets with thousands of sequences. This proposal will connect and build upon our two recent successful methods, currently implemented in independent packages: (1) CodonPhyML for fast maximum likelihood phylogeny inference for protein-coding genes (Gil et al. 2013 Mol Biol Evol), and (2) ProGraphMSA for fast probabilistic graph-based phylogeny-aware alignment (Szalkowski 2012 PLoS ONE; Szalkowski, Anisimova 2013, Nucleic Acids Res). To circumvent the computational difficulties posed by combining indel and substitution processes, we will use the most recent Poisson indel process (PIP; Bouchard-Cote, Jordan, 2013), which is a modification of TKF91 but has linear time complexity. In addition, the existing arsenal of CodonPhyML’s substitution models will be used to improve accuracy of joint estimation, since these models describe protein-coding genes more realistically by explicitly including the structure of the genetic code and selection pressures at the protein level. Further, ProGraphMSA provides one of the fastest and most accurate alignment heuristics, which distinguishes and correctly penalizes insertions and deletions, accounts for sequence divergence, and is the only alignment method that incorporates sequence content heterogeneity, alternative splicing and repeats.Combining these state-of the art methods for the first time in a maximum likelihood JATI algorithm, here we aim to: (1) develop new efficient heuristics to search through the joint space of alignment and tree structures combined with optimization of model parameters and branch lengths, (2) develop a sampling procedure during our the joint heuristic search that enables approximation of marginal likelihoods over MSAs and of confidence sets for inferred point phylogenies. As a consequence, the new methodology will allow not only more accurate phylogeny and alignment inference but will also facilitate the estimation of statistical supports for inferred tree partitions and reconstruct indel and substitution history.  High performance computing techniques will ensure that the implementation is optimized for memory usage and speed using parallelization (also on GPUs). This will support the phylogenetic analyses of genomic/metagenomic data or NGS data with thousands of sequences from viral/bacterial pathogens or antibody data from infected donors. Based on our own current collaborations with industry, we see that our new JATI method will be in high demand not only in academic projects but also in pharmaceutical and biotech industry.",Zürcher Hochschule für Angewandte Wissenschaften,Wädenswil,553726,0000-0001-8145-7966,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",Germany,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,157064,"Media relations: print media, online media",Die Tapanuli-Orang-Utans: Zürcher Forschende bestimmen neuen Menschenaffen,https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/die-tapanuli-orang-utans-zuercher-forschende-entdecken-neue-menschenaffenart-ld.1325882,2017

Progressive pump dysfunction and sudden cardiac death are the primary causes of mortality in HF. Despite the implementation of guideline-mandated pharmacological therapies, the prognosis of HF patients remains poor. In this scenario, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), has emerge as one of the most important breakthroughs in the treatment of HF, with remarkably consistent positive benefit in CRT treated patients. Nowadays CRT can treat 25-30% of patients with symptomatic HF and it is recommended in HF patients in NYHA class II-IV, presenting with left bundle branch block (LBBB) and/or QRS duration >120ms. Despite these stringent criteria for the selection of CRT candidates, the rate of non-response remains significant (30-50%).Especially in the field of HF cardiology, the use of CRT has raised concerns, because it was not understood how CRT as an electrical therapy could solve a mechanical problem like HF. Although recent clinical observations have indicated a close relationship between the QRS duration and response to CRT, the mechanism behind the relationship between CRT response and QRS duration is not entirely clear. Understanding the non-trivial interplay between electrical activation and mechanical contraction, including the evaluation of in-vivo electromechanical (EM) coupling, is crucial for full mechanistic understanding of CRT’s mode of action. Such a characterization will greatly help in 1) identifying the ideal substrate for CRT response; and 2) further strengthening the response in those patients who benefit from CRT. We postulate that a multimodal approach, integrating detailed mechanical and electrical information, can provide additional valuable information about the disease in the individual patient.We recently developed a novel method for the in-vivo EM assessment, and in the present project we propose to explore the value of various novel descriptors of EM coupling for the prediction of CRT response in a larger population. In detail the project aims at:1)comparing measures of strain obtained by electroanatomical mapping with those derived from tagged CMR, and investigate the relation of both strain measures with the sequence of electrical activation.2)comparing the presence of low endocardial voltages with the presence of scar tissue as from delayed enhanced CMR, and investigate whether low voltage correlates with shorter diastolic perfusion time;3)evaluating the predictive values of the slope and intercept of the relation between local electrical activation and mechanical contraction as well as the presence of low voltage regions with CRT response;4)creating a multivariate model including all novel electrical and mechanical measurements as well as scar as predictors of a positive CRT outcome in a 6-month follow-up.",Cardiocentro Ticino,Lugano,550934,0000-0003-2116-6993,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Millions of patients are affected, but efficient treatments are not available. Moreover, because of the aging of the population in industrialized countries the number of patients suffering with retinal degeneration will increase since age is a significant risk factor. Among the severe retinal degenerations age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most frequent cause of blindness in patients older than 60 years. AMD is a chronic progressive disease that appears to result from age-associated alterations that include impaired phagocytosis by and loss of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, alteration in Bruch’s membrane and inflammatory reactions followed by photoreceptor and possibly retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degradation. AMD presents two distinct forms, a slow progressing non-vascular (“dry”) and a rapidly progressing neovascular (“wet”) form. In wet AMD the growth of new choroidal vessels through Bruch’s membrane damages the interface between Bruch’s membrane, RPE and photoreceptor cells, leading to RPE and photoreceptor cell degeneration. The choroidal neovascularization (CNV) appears to result from increased production of pro-angiogenic stimuli, e.g. vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and decreased availability of anti-angiogenic stimuli, e.g. pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF). Thus, current treatments for wet AMD consists mostly of intravitreal injections of VEGF antibodies restoring vision in about 40% and arresting the disease in 90% of patients. For dry AMD no treatments are available. However, although the initiating event in dry AMD remains unclear, numerous works have linked oxidative damage and inflammation with progression of the disease. We postulate that in dry AMD oxidative stress and inflammation are two major events leading to a gradual loss of RPE cells over time. This loss not only disrupts the natural anatomy of the photoreceptor-RPE unit, but simultaneously decreases the level of neuroprotective factors synthesized by RPE cells, e.g. PEDF, insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and others, which in turn lead to degeneration of photoreceptors and RGCs. Preliminary data from our laboratory (see “Preliminary Results” section) show that the addition of PEDF to retina organ cultures protects both photoreceptors and RGCs. Here we propose to transfect RPE/IPE cells with combinations of the PEDF, IGF-1 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) genes using the hyperactive Sleeping Beauty (SB100X) transposon system. Neuroprotective effectiveness of these proteins secreted by transfected RPE cells alone and in combinations will be evaluated on cultured RGCs and in a retina organ culture system. The transfected cells that secrete the most effective protein combination will be transplanted subretinally to CEP-adducted mice. The transplanted cells should secrete the appropriate combination of factors and should prevent further RPE cell and retinal degeneration typical for AMD, thereby slow or stop progression of the disease. In the carboxyethylpyrrole (CEP) model, mice are immunized with CEP-adducted proteins provoking pathological retinal alterations and the development of drusen similar to what occurs in dry AMD. Even though RPE/IPE cells will be transfected with the SB100X system, which has been shown to be safer than viral gene delivery, the possibility of unforseen side effects remain and elimination of the transplanted cells would be desirable. For such purpose we will introduce into the transplanted cells the suicide gene, herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK). If necessary, topical administration of ganciclovir would activate the HSV-TK and be sufficient to remove the transplanted, transfected cells.",Clinique d'Ophtalmologie Hôpitaux Universitaires de Genève,Genève 14,630855,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",Germany,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Crystal structures of p53 in complex with non-specific DNA will be determined and compared to structures with specific DNA. Stopped-flow fluorescence anisotropy will delineate the steps of p53 DNA binding. The second aim examines the hypothesis that translesion polymerases have a checkpoint function.

Our goal is to describe the evolutionary origins of this cognitive architecture, to understand the major transition that has taken place in human evolution from non-linguistic to linguistic communication. The transition to language was unlikely the result of a single evolutionary event but caused by gradual changes in a number of pivotal components. Some appear to be phylogenetically old, with deep roots in the primate evolutionary history; others may have emerged more recently, after the split between humans and the great apes. Comparative research can help to identify the evolutionary history of these components.In recent years a lot of progress has been made to chart the natural communication and cognition of our closest living relatives, the chimpanzees and bonobos, and of many other species of primates. As a result, there is now good evidence that primates use signals in intentional and referential ways, that they are able to use arbitrary sound patterns to refer to external events, and that signal combinations can be communicatively important for them. One core aspect of language, however - the acquisition of communicative competence -- has received relatively little empirical attention by comparative research. Although there is a large literature on how human infants acquire language, little systematic research has been carried out to understand how non-human primates acquire their communicative capacities and skills.Here, we propose a set of observational and experimental studies to make progress in this domain. Our first approach is to target the full vocal repertoire of different primate species to capture the full acoustic variance and then to look for signs of social learning within the different call types. We will make use of recent advances in computational neurobiology by using algorithms developed in vision research for acoustic feature detection. Our second approach is experimental and will target the question of how sound-meaning linkages are established in primates. To this end, we will carry out a series of experiments with chimpanzees, both in captivity and in the wild, and with several monkey species, particularly Diana monkeys, sooty mangabeys and vervet monkeys in their natural habitats. In doing so, we will pay additional attention to ontogenetic effects by sampling individuals of different age/sex classes. We will use novel infrared thermography to assess social learning in wild animals, in addition to more traditional behavioural measures, such as gaze direction, locomotion and vocal behaviour.Our overall goal is to make progress with an important scientific problem, that is, how primates acquire the ability to socially learn to communicate, by observing and interacting with others, a core component of the human language faculty.",Institut de Biologie Université de Neuchâtel,Neuchâtel,95436,0000-0001-8378-088X,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,166458,"Media relations: print media, online media",can prairie dogs talk?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/12/magazine/can-prairie-dogs-talk.html,2017

In multi-armed bandit problems, an agent is asked to repeatedly select one of many actions (arms) for which the agent receives an unknown reward; solutions require a careful tradeoff between exploration (gaining new knowledge about the rewards) and exploitation (using current knowledge to maximize rewards). This simple model has found modern applications in a many domains including e-Commerce (e.g., online advertising [CKRU08, LPP10]), Networking (e.g., adaptive routing [AK04]), Operations Research (e.g., scheduling and inventory systems [MT08]), Social Science (e.g., clinical trials and experimental design [HS91, OHS01]), Ecology [SRL13] and Finance (e.g., portfolio selection [GS11a, SLM12]).In the classical setting, at each time step the agent only observes the reward for the action which she selects. However, in realistic settings, individuals often have access to additional side information, e.g., via their social or economic network, which they can use to make enhanced decisions. This phenomenon has been observed in the Social and Natural Sciences, for example, in the acquisition of consumer products by individuals, the adoption of new technologies in agriculture, the prevalence and spread of corruption, and in the behavior of animals such as squirrels (see, e.g., [LBG48, KL55, ZAA07, Yoo12, San06, ASC12]). Hence, a natural question arises: How should an agent incorporate side observations in order to maximize their rewards, and how much improvement can such information bring? Indeed, such questions have inspired much recent and exciting work in Computer Science and Economics due to the realistic and relevant framework they address.The central goal of this project is to integrate the model of selfish agents in a network with the concept of reward maximization; both form key components of important settings and we believe that only in conjunction can relevant solutions be found. Specifically, we plan to consider bandit models where selfish agents playing against a multi-armed bandit are connected by a network; each agent can observe the actions and rewards of their neighbors in addition to their own, and each strives to maximize their own rewards. In summary, this project aims to lay the foundations for understanding selfish behavior in bandit optimization for networked agents, bridging gaps in an increasingly important problem from both theoretical and practical perspectives. It requires a unique synthesis of concepts from algorithms, game theory and networks, and has the promise to push forward state of the art techniques for the ubiquitous problem of adaptive decision making for networked agents.",Laboratoire pour les communications informatiques et leurs applications 3 EPFL - IC - ISC - LCA3,Lausanne,650263,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

As a result of these human activities, soil erosion experienced a sharp increase. Although the sustainable use of soil is a pressing societal issue, little is known about the history of human impact on soil and pre-anthropogenic conditions. In this project, we propose to analyze lake sediments to reconstruct changes in soil erosion and soil carbon dynamics with the evolution of land-use.In order to distinguish how different types of farming impact soil and lake ecosystems, we will recover and analyze sediment cores from four lakes with contrasting histories of human occupation and land-use in their catchment. The first site, in Greenland, experienced human occupation for only a limited time (985-1450 AD), with almost exclusively pastoral activities in its watershed. Land abandonment during the following 500 yr - until the recent re-establishment of modern farming - led to a progressive re-naturalization of the environment. The second site, in the Republic of Karelia (NW Russia), experienced an unconventional shift from cropland to pasture in 1940 AD, as the former Finnish territory was ceded back to the Soviet Union. The third site, Lake Murten in Switzerland, was chosen as representative of the traditional long-term evolution into intensive farming, i.e. from forest to pasture to agriculture. The last site, Lake Joux in the Swiss Jura Mountain, is currently under investigation as part of a pilot study and experienced a more tardive human occupation.Key to this research, we will use an innovative approach to quantify soil degradation and link it to farming practices: We will analyze lacustrine sediments to reconstruct the soil residence time of organic molecules originating from terrestrial plants and soil bacteria. We will use radiocarbon dating to assess the age differences between rapidly deposited plant debris and these fossil molecules (biomarkers) that are retained in the soil system for some time. This information will increase our understanding of the extent of human disturbance on soil carbon dynamics, and provide tools to assess measures taken for the sustainable use of soils. Our hypothesis is that the development of modern practices such as tillage affected deeper soils than ever before. The flushing of these old soils into lake repositories should be reflected by a significant ageing of the terrestrial biomarkers relative to the “fresh” plant debris deposited in the same sediment layers. However, it may be possible that early deforestation or grazing played the most significant role in the soil destabilization process. This study will allow discriminating the relative impact of these different land-use activities.The horizons of interest will be detected by changes in sedimentological and geochemical characteristics in the sediment cores. The vegetation changes that accompany the evolution of agricultural practices will be determined from pollen assemblage. In conclusion, this study will emphasize the relevance of paleolimnological approaches to assess not only the reference ecological conditions for modern lakes but also the reference state for soil.",Eawag,Dübendorf,540015,0000-0003-2349-0826,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication;Research Infrastructures;Exchange of personnel",Switzerland,Peer-reviewed,Review article (peer-reviewed),Molecular Biomarkers of Anthropic Impacts in Natural Archives: A Review,"Dubois Nathalie,  Jacob Jérémy",Published,2016,,10.3389/fevo.2016.00092,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2016.00092/full,Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution,,Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution,4,,92,,Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution,,,160066,"Media relations: print media, online media", news   Engineering sciences Natural Sciences Earth and Environment Medicine and Life Sciences Innov,https://www.myscience.ch/en/news/2018/even_the_ancient_romans_were_polluters-2018-eawag,2018

As a result of changing environmental conditions over millennia, soil erosion and denudation processes also change substantially. Currently, our knowledge in this field is incomplete and very fragmented. Usually, only averaged long-term erosion or denudation rates are determined for soils and landscapes. The fact that soil erosion processes are discontinuous over time is an aspect that is in most cases completely neglected. An evolutional approach would be, thus, necessary to address such an issue. Such a task is however difficult to be fulfilled. Well-defined (or -controlled) settings are needed to calculate soil mass balances and particularly mass losses due to erosion for a given soil profile.Landscapes affected by intense erosion and denudation may be characterized by boulder fields or “tor” and “bornhardt” landforms, i.e. tower-like or dome-shaped, often castellated, residual rock boulders (resistant to erosion) “growing” from gentle landforms. Determining the speed of boulder exhumation, soil erosion rates over different time periods can be deduced. Using cosmogenic nuclide techniques (10Be), the vertical profile of boulders surfaces can be dated. This allows the determination of their exhumation rate and subsequently the calculation of soil erosion rates over time-intervals (continuous and over millennia). This would then enable a comparison of past erosion rates to modern rates. Modern rates (covering several decades) of soil erosion can be determined by other isotope techniques (e.g., 239+240Pu in the surrounding soils).Ideal settings and a considerable dataset about chemical and mineral weathering and first rather larger scale estimates of erosion rates are available for the Sila Massif in southern Italy. This Mediterranean environment represents a tectonically active area. The upland plateaus consist of old planation surfaces, bordered by steep slopes, and are characterised by granitic spheroidal boulders which form wide boulder fields. We consequently have the hypothesis that by measuring the in situ produced 10Be content (in quartz) at different height levels along a rock boulder (from the soil surface to the top of boulders), the age(s) of exposure can be derived and subsequent total denudation rates of surrounding weathered materials (grus or saprolite) and soils be obtained. This would be an elegant way to calculate erosion rates for different time-steps that cover almost the entire period of soil evolution (estimated to be in the order of 100 ka or more). Such an approach would give insight into  a) the overall denudation and erosion rates over the whole periodb) erosion and denudation rates during time segments of the Pleistocene and Holocenec) volumes of loose material that were removed from the uplands and that entered the drainage river system in this time span. The chosen multi-methodological approach will allow for a mutual control and cross-check of such data. The methods include geomorphic mapping to derive overall soil erosion rates at the Sila uplands, vertical sampling of boulders and determination of the speed of their long-term exhumation (out of weathering profiles and soils) to derive soil erosion rates and the determination of soil erosion rates over given time intervals using different isotopes (in soils; 10Be for long-term rates and Pu for short-term rates). The exhumation rate of rock boulders will be determined by using in situ cosmogenic nuclides (10Be). An independent comparison will be made possible by estimating the long-term (millennial time scale), average erosion rates using in situ-produced 10Be in soils. In addition, existing geomorphic data (geomorphic mapping of palaeosurfaces) of the region will be evaluated to derive estimates of average surface erosion rates. This allows a comparison and cross check of the data derived from 10Be measurements. Short-term erosion rates will be estimated using 239+240Pu isotopes in soils. Furthermore, d13C in soils will be tested as a qualitative soil erosion indicator. This multi-methodological approach allows for a cross-check and validation of the obtained results and enables the derivation of temporal erosion rates from decades over millennia. Such an approach that uses soils, boulders and geomorphic mapping to determine soil erosion and that tries to derive soil erosion rates over continuous time-intervals is certainly novel has not yet been performed so far.",Geographisches Institut Universität Zürich,Zürich,91618,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication;Research Infrastructures",Italy,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),Climate and relief-induced controls on the temporal variability of denudation rates in a granitic upland,,Published,2019,,10.1002/esp.4681,https://www.geraldraab.com/app/download/7933885256/Raab%20et%20al.%202019.pdf?t=1565077191,Earth Surface Processes and Landforms,,Earth Surface Processes and Landforms,,,–,,Earth Surface Processes and Landforms,,How soil erosion rates evolved over the last about 100 kyr and how they relate to environmental and climate variability is largely unknown. This is due to a lack of suitable archives that help to trace this evolution. We determined in situ cosmogenic 10Be along vertical landforms (tors boulders and scarps) on the Sila Massif to unravel their local exhumation patterns to develop a surface denudation model over millennia.  Due to the physical resistance of tors their rate of exhumation may be used to derive surface and thus soil denudation rates over time. We derived soil denudation rates that varied in the range of 0–0.40 mm year 1. The investigated boulders however appear to have experienced repositioning processes about 20–25 ka BP and were therefore a less reliable archive. The scarps of the Sila upland showed a rapid bedrock exposure within the last 8–15 ka. Overall the denudation rates increased steadily after 75 ka BP but remained low until about 17 ka BP. The exhumation rates indicate a denudation pulse that occurred about 17–5 ka BP. Since then the rates have continuously decreased.  We identify three key factors for these developments – climate topography and vegetation. Between 75 and 17 ka BP climate was colder and drier than today. The rapid changes towards warmer and humid conditions at the Pleistocene Holocene transition apparently increased denudation rates. A denser vegetation cover with time counteracted denudation.   Topography also determined the extent of denudation rates in the upland regime. On slopes denudation rates were generally higher than on planar surfaces. By determining the exhumation rates of tors and scars soil erosion rates could be determined over long timescales and be related to topography and particularly to climate. This is key for understanding geomorphic dynamics under current environmental settings and future climate change.,162338,"Media relations: print media, online media",Eis am Stiel in der Bodenforschung,https://www.geo.uzh.ch/de/events/aktuelle-publikationen/2019-06-19-Eis-am-Stiel.html,2019

We focuss in particular on the effects of coupling between one dimensional structures, on their response to out of equilibrium (OEQ) perturbations. We compute time dependent observables in a disordered system  and look also at its transient response. We examine the case of heavy impurities in a quantum bath taking into account effects beyond the one dimensional case. We examine the connection between a problem of heavy impurities and the case of a quenched disordered system. We look at the quantum transport through one- and quasi-one dimensional structure and in particular the transverse response such as the Hall effect.In addition to the intrinsic theoretical interest of these questions they are pertinent for a large number of experimental realizations. The results of the theoretical analysis will thus be investigated in close collaboration with experimental groups working on these subjects. On the analytical side we will treat such systems using the arsenal of techniques normally used for low dimensional systems such as bosonization, field theory and Keldysh technique, and for disordered systems such as replicas and the renormalization group. On the numerical side we will make heavy use of the time dependent density matrix renormalization group technique in its various incarnations (t-DMRG).The project gravitates around four main directions. All aspects of the project are potentially relevant both for condensed matter systems and for cold atomic gases, even if some parts are of course more naturally focussed on one aspect depending on available experimental realizations.

A key role was played by the available instrumentation that allowed us to push precision and thus detection limits to an unprecedented level. HARPS - the High-Accuracy Radial-velocity Planet Searcher - is the diamond tip of these machines. It was developed and built by an international Consortium of institutes led by the Geneva Observatory of the Geneva University and delivered to the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in exchange of Guaranteed-Time Observations (GTO). In the frame of these GTO we conducted a fruitful scientific program that led to the discovery of most of the Earth-mass and super-Earth planets known to date through the RV technique. Also, the comprehensive survey and the subsequent large programs contributed in a unique way to the understanding of the dynamics of planetary systems, and gave, through statistics and comparison with theoretical models, an insight into the formation processes of these systems.Recent results and developments in the domain of extra-solar planets demonstrate that high-fidelity spectroscopy has acquired and will further deploy a determinant role for the understanding of exoplanets, their atmospheres and their formation and evolution. Our group owns the needed experience and expertise to contribute in a significant way to the new situation. The present application aims at best exploiting this heritage and the numerous scientific collaborations by promoting three main activities:a)Acquire most precise and accurate radial-velocity and spectroscopic measurements for the search and characterization of Earth-like planets.b)Understand the stellar effects that set limits to high-fidelity spectroscopy. Develop tools to monitor these effects or to correct for them.c)Understand the instrumental effects that set limits to high-fidelity spectroscopy with particular emphasis to what we think today to be the limiting factors, i.e. the wavelength calibration.These activities will allow us to remain at the forefront of technological development and strengthen our contribution to existing projects. Besides operating CORALIE on the EULER telescope, we have been leading the development and the scientific exploitation of HARPS and HARPS-N, and we are PI-institute and project-lead of the ESPRESSO project, one of the most ambitious ESO instrument being built at present. These activities require continuous participation and follow-up, which are supported by the present research project. The future is even brighter and promises even more fascinating work. In fact, spectroscopic observation will be high complementary to transit search missions such as TESS, CHEOPS, NGTS and PLATO. Our group is involved in all of them and contributes in preparing the future scientific activities. Furthermore, we collaborate in the construction of the SpiRou@CFTH spectrograph, participate to the HiReS initiative which foresees the construction of a high-precision spectrograph for the European Extremely Large Telescope. Finally, we have been solicited by the European Southern Observatory to build an infrared HARPS-like instrument for the 3.6-m telescope.The many results obtained in the field of exoplanets arose to a significant fraction from our successful participation in instrumentation projects. They deliver to us the required experience but also the observing time for carrying out our programs. The field of extra-solar planets is evolving very rapidly, however. In order to keep pace with continuously new challenges we need to extend our domain of competences. Also, we need support for the important scientific activities around instrumental project and on-going observational programs.

Amongst the traditional strategies currently used to produce green energy from renewable sources, the possibility of obtaining a highly energetic and environmental friendly fuel like hydrogen using sunlight and water as starting sources would have an enormous impact on the everyday life. A system capable of realising water splitting by using sunlight has been the “Holy Grail” of scientific research for at least three decades. Semiconductor Quantum Dots have recently been object of a growing attention for application in solar cells and optoelectronic devices, due to their bright performances in terms of light absorption and photostability. However, only a very few system based on Quantum Dots have been reported so far in the field of artificial photosynthesis and in most cases such systems have been only poorly characterised in terms of electron transfer dynamics. Here we propose a new approach based on a family of dyads and triads containing a semiconductor Quantum Dot as sensitizer and transition metals-based catalysts. The objectives of this proposal can be summarized as follows:1) Synthesis of dyads containing oxidising moieties based on Ir(III) and Fe(II) complexes functionalised with spacers of different length and chemical nature and with a dithiocarbamate connecting unit. 2) Synthesis of dyads containing reducing moieties based on Co(III) and Co(II) complexes functionalised with spacers of different length and chemical nature and with a dithiocarbamate connecting unit.3) Synthesis of triads containing oxidation and reducing moieties connected to a rigid scaffold. 4) In-depth study of the photophysical properties of such dyads and triads, with special attention to the electron/hole transfer dynamics taking place between the Quantum Dot (sensitizer) and the metal complexes (photocatalysts) aimed at the realization of an optimised integrated system for water splitting.Compared to the systems so far realized in this field, our strategy shows several advantages: • Semiconductor Quantum Dots show high photostability (in the presence of suitable capping units) and high molar extinction coefficients, thus they are ideal light harvesting units.• Transition metal complexes can be attached to the Quantum Dots surface by dithiocarbamate functional groups, which can be easily prepared starting from primary amines. • The modularity of the system enables to optimise separately the two catalytic moieties.• The study of the electron transfer mechanisms in dyads will enable us to develop a strategy to avoid back-electron transfer upon induction of a kinetic-controlled unidirectional electron transfer in triads. We argue that the research presented in this proposal represents a major step towards the definition of a straightforward method for the realization of integrated systems (triads) for light-driven water splitting. Besides the evident impact of such systems on the everyday life, the in-depth investigation of the photoinduced electron transfer process is expected to give a remarkable contribution to the photochemical research in the field of artificial photosynthesis.

On the one hand, we find the longstanding tradition of urbanism based on norms and values. The discourse of this urban design method relies on a critic of the city as it exists. Today’s iterations bring up valid concerns about the current state of the city to justify their counter-models : environmental urgency, massive sprawl, unregulated developments or infrastructural issues.On the other hand, another attitude has emerged in the past decades. It is clearly expressed in one major tendency of urban projects in Europe: prospective “strategies” and “territorial projects”, like the ones presented for the Grand Paris consultation in 2007, develop long-term scenarios and narratives towards the transformation of existing conditions of living: “We assume that the metropolis of tomorrow is mainly here already” (Klouche et al., 2009). This type of urban design does not borrow (or not only) ancient forms taken from the dense and regulated city. Neither does it suggest and plan new radical forms of organizing the land.On the contrary, these contemporary tools of urban project are based on the acceptance of the metropolis as a given condition and its renewed lecture as it is.In the complex arborescence of urban theories, the conditions for the emergence of these relatively new branches have not been fully explored yet. The research intends to put in historical perspective this paradigm that today’s architecture and urban design convey to ground their practices and discourses. It takes part in an effort to reassess current urban theories and to continue pursuing advanced and innovative design methods on territories that are more and more complex, hybrid and interrelated. Inside the territory of postwar urban theories and established historiographies, the research seeks to map a genealogy of pioneer methods and motifs in the excavation of the city that is. Excavating the “city that is” means to record what takes place in the metropolis, accepting it as a source of learnings. As it is not based on the city that was or the city that should be, such endeavor encounters the difficulty to represent and integrate what usually overflows architecture and urban design: the everyday of the metropolis. The excavation of the “city that is” requires to relocate the everyday inside what can be shown in a form. This is precisely the role of aesthetic procedures developed by architects to decipher what they notice when looking at the city in front of them.The suggested research seeks three main objectives: 1-Propose theoretical foundations for the excavation of 'the city that is'. The research posits that the conditions and reasons for its emergence are to be found in the irruption of the concept of everyday life both in sciences and arts in the western mid-century context. 2-Reveal shared patterns and procedures that were elaborated to transcribe and relocate the everyday inside the field of architecture and urban design. We postulate that pioneer architects and critics of the excavation of the “city that is” operate through aesthetic reappropriations of the everyday. 3-Explore the consequences in the redistribution of the remits of architecture and the limits of this method of analysis and design. We consider that it provoked a critical reversal: by dropping the radical critique of what is outside of the frame, the critique has turned against the frame itself.",Laboratoire d'architecture de processeurs EPFL - IC - ISIM - LAP,Lausanne,662451,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results",France,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Rail networks in large Swiss cities must account for considerable influxes and effluxes of passengers at different times of the day and week. The optimization of the existing infrastructure requires consideration of the needs of different types of patrons. For example, passengers traveling for business tend to travel alone and maximize the efficiency of their trip in terms of time and cost. In contrast, tourists and families often travel in small groups and explore their surroundings at a slower pace. The navigation decisions made by different types of patrons result in uneven spatiotemporal distributions along the system (i.e., pockets of congestion and underutilization) that may compromise their safety. Understanding patron behavior with different spatial constraints (e.g., the physical infrastructure) is essential for the performance and future development of the system.Social wayfinding is multi-agent, spatial, decision making. Modeling this process involves an understanding of both individuals’ strategies and collective dynamics. These two levels of explanation interact and constrain each other, but this reciprocity is typically overlooked in the literature. Specifically, previous research has either focused on individuals’ spatial decision making in the absence of social influences or the emergence of crowd behavior from individuals’ low-level, perceptual and motoric, processes. This approach to investigating crowd behavior has failed to account for the cognitive processes that underlie most human movement. The present project will unify these two previously disparate fields in order to provide a more comprehensive understanding of wayfinding behavior in indoor environments.The proposal addresses three different levels of social wayfinding: individual, small-group, and crowd levels. These levels constitute the basis of three work packages (WPs) with real-world and virtual reality experiments. At the individual level (WP1), we will investigate the impact of other people on individuals’ wayfinding decisions. Here, we will consider social factors such as the presence, direction, and density of a moving crowd during a wayfinding task.  The small-group level (WP2) focuses on the effect of group membership on wayfinding decisions in collaborative contexts. This work package will use participants’ gaze and walking patterns in order to identify differences in the wayfinding strategies of individuals and small groups. Research on crowd behavior (WP3) will address the relationship between individuals’ wayfinding strategies and emergent dynamics (e.g., lane formation, bottlenecks during evacuations). We will evaluate changes in crowd behavior that result from differences in context (e.g., reinforcement for either cooperative or competitive behavior) and from differences in environmental structure (e.g., the organization of rooms in a building).",Chair of Cognitive Science D-GESS ETH Zurich,Zürich,576398,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Research Infrastructures",Switzerland,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),A Networked Desktop Virtual Reality Setup for Decision Science and Navigation Experiments with Multiple Participants,"Zhao Hantao,  Thrash Tyler,  Wehrli Stefan,  Hölscher Christoph,  Kapadia Mubbasir,  Grübel Jascha,  Weibel Raphael P.,  Schinazi Victor R.",Published,2018,,10.3791/58155,,Journal of Visualized Experiments,,Journal of Visualized Experiments,,138,"e58155, p1","e58155, p7",Journal of Visualized Experiments,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The traditional approach to problems like environmental damage, animal cruelty, or labor coercion is to call for government to regulate or tax activities that impose such externalities. However, due to, for example, regulatory capture or lack of information, governments often fail to correct such market failures. Hence, the idea of individual and corporate social responsibility as a policy tool-to substitute or complement more traditional policy instruments-has a great deal of appeal. Despite the importance of this issue, there is little research in economics so far seeking to understand whether social responsibility presents an actual remedy for negative impacts of market activity. In particular, little is known about how market social responsibility is influenced by key market characteristics, such as production technologies, regulatory institutions and social norms.The proposed research will provide insights into the viability of social responsibility as a remedy to market failures due to negative external effects. It will advance our knowledge of the technological, institutional, and societal factors that shape socially responsible market behavior. Beyond producing novel and valuable academic insights, this research will identify mechanisms that can be applied to facilitate social responsibility in real-world markets, thus providing applicable insights that are relevant for policymakers and practitioners.All six projects of this proposal rely on experimental methods in order to causally investigate factors that influence the extent to which market participants exhibit concern for social impact. Project 1 examines how the nature of production technologies and externalities interact to influence socially responsible behavior. Project 2 determines whether economic development creates greater concern for alleviating negative external effects, especially when it is accompanied by increased wealth inequality. Project 3 studies how capital markets influence the ability of firms to engage in social responsibility-given the capital financing constraints faced by firms in the real world, it is infeasible for them to sacrifice profit out of a concern for social responsibility, unless investors support such behavior. Project 4 studies whether specific policy instruments, such as taxes or command-and-control regulation, crowd out market participants’ intrinsic social concern and thus undermine the voluntary manifestation of socially responsible market behavior. Finally, in addition to standard regulatory tools, policies that enhance social norms might be a valuable complement or substitute to foster socially responsible market behavior. Hence, Projects 5 and 6 investigate how different forms of social influence, public debate and social comparison, respectively, encourage market participants to adopt socially responsible market behavior and internalize the negative externalities of their market activity.",Institut für Volkswirtschaftslehre Wirtschaftswissenschaftliche Fakultät Universität Zürich,Zürich,598331,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",China,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The resource-based theory (RBT) posits that the possession of valuable, rare, inimitable and non-substitutable resources is a key antecedent of competitive advantage and firm performance. However, organizations are faced with the challenge to acquire or build these resources often years before their value becomes clear from their deployment in product markets. While early studies in the resource-based theory view resource value as an independent characteristic of the underlying resource that can be identified ex ante (Barney, 1986), both the origins of resource-based theory in Penrose’s (1959) growth theory and recent theoretical work on strategic factor markets suggest that resource value may be contingent on the presence of complementary resources (Adegbesan, 2009), the firm’s positioning in the marketplace (Schmidt & Keil, 2013), the characteristics of decision makers (Gruber, MacMillan, & Thompson, 2013) and may change as the firm and its managers engage in active resource management (Rumelt, 2010). Notwithstanding these theoretical claims, research has yet to directly empirically explore whether and how these factors affect resource value and firms’ decision making regarding resources. In the proposed research project, we test prior theoretical arguments and develop and test novel theory on the interaction of complementary resources and demand-side factors on the resource value of new patented molecules in the context of pharmaceutical R&D processes. Specifically, we investigate how the likelihood of further development of a patented molecule at different stages of the R&D process and ultimately its introduction and success in the market place depend on characteristics of the resource (e.g., internal versus external technology, novelty, involvement of star scientists), the presence of upstream and downstream complementary resources (e.g., technological and scientific strength, R&D capabilities, marketing and sales capabilities), and demand characteristics (e.g., market demand, level of competition, firm position in the market segment). To test our predictions, we plan to extend a unique database of new product development projects in the pharmaceutical industry combining a variety of secondary data sources over a period of over 20 years. We will employ state-of-the-art longitudinal regression techniques to address a substantial estimation issues (e.g., endogeneity) that characterize multistage development projects.With this project, we intend to make four contributions to the literature. First, our study will extend recent theorizing in the resource-based theory and strategic factor market theory on the determinants of resource value and its management. In particular, we extend prior static accounts of resource value towards a dynamic theory that takes differences along the resource development process into consideration. We further examine how the relationship between standalone value, complementary assets, and market position on resource value differs depending on (1) the origin of a technological resource inside the focal firm or an external partner, (2) the novelty of the resource and (3) the involvement of star scientists in creating a technological resource. Second, our study will provide sorely needed empirical evidence and testing of prior theorizing on resource value in strategic factor market theory (e.g., Adegbesan, 2009; Schmidt & Keil, 2013) and in the RBT more broadly. Prior research has been mostly theoretical and direct testing of recent theoretical predictions has been absent. Third, the study will contribute to the demand-based view by explicitly integrating demand-based arguments into the logic of the resource-based theory and by providing important new empirical evidence to a literature that has been mostly theoretical up to the point. Finally, our study will also contribute to the literature on innovation processes by developing a coherent theoretical framework grounded in the resource-based theory to explain decision making during different stages of the innovation process and its outcomes. Prior research on innovation processes has often been criticized as atheoretical and lacking a grounding in strong theory (e.g., Brown & Eisenhardt, 1995; Crossan & Apaydin, 2010).",Institut für Betriebswirtschaftslehre Universität Zürich,Zürich,633769,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication;Research Infrastructures;Exchange of personnel",Greece,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Trained in one approach, they seek complements in other approaches when they find conceptual and practical weaknesses of their original approach. There is, however, little research on the effects of such an “assimilative integration”, in our view mainly due to the difficulty of doing valid research on this question. Whereas there is more research on the effects of “pure” approaches, most practitioners use these approaches only in adapted forms. This leads to a dissatisfactory state where much of the available evidence does not tell us much about prevailing practice. While it is impossible to include all variants of psychotherapy integration in one study it would be a major step forward if a common form of integration of concepts and specific interventions into an established treatment could be studied in an exemplary way. This is at the heart of the project proposed here. With the term “General Psychotherapy” Grawe (2004) has postulated an ongoing process of including all interventions and concepts relevant for a domain, be they from other approaches to psychotherapy or concepts from basic science. As all these are ever changing and developing, General Psychotherapy is rather a process, an ideal to strive at, than a state that can ever be reached. “Psychological Therapy” (PT) is a therapeutic approach largely corresponding to the ideas of General Psychotherapy. It draws mainly on empirically validated interventions from Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) and is based on concepts with a strong basis in academic psychology and neigh¬boring fields. With an emphasis on explicit individual case conceptualizations, reference to general therapeutic factors, and an explicit prescriptive concept for building and maintaining the therapeutic relationship, PT has a major influence in the field.The range of emotion-related interventions commonly used in PT is, however, limited when compared with an approach like Emotion Focused Therapy (EFT; Greenberg, 2010). EFT appears thus as a suitable complement and enrichment to PT as commonly practiced. In various places therapists have indeed begun to combine CBT with EFT. There is increa-sing evidence for the effectiveness of the latter, it fulfills the APA criteria of an empirically validated treatment for depression and couples therapy, and evidence for more diagnoses has been published. However, effects of integrating EFT-based interventions in a way that is close to common integrative practice have not yet been studied.The goal of this project is to compare PT as usual (PT-TAU) with PT with integrated EFT elements (PT-EFT). 130 patients out of the routine practice of the Bernese psychotherapy outpatient clinic, suffering from depressive, anxiety or adjustment disorders, are to be treated by 20 therapists in each treatment condition. While the competency and adhe-rence to the respective condition will be checked, therapists will vary in general therapy experience and extent of trai-ning, which will allow evaluating the influence of these variables. To secure balance regarding the amount of training and supervision for the project, PS-TAU will be supplemented with additional units elaborating on some elements that are already part of PT. The assessment will cover standard self-report questionnaires common for this kind of research, Goal Attainment Sca-ling, standardized diagnostic interviews, symptom ratings by clinicians, and implicit assessment of motivation. Further assessments each with small parts of the sample will use ambulatory assessment via smartphones to more validly cap-ture behavior changes in real life, and recordings of EEG responses in individually meaningful and emotionally challen-ging situations to assess neurobiological processes associated with therapeutic change processes. The main questions are whether the integration of central EFT elements leads to deeper and more lasting effects compared to the commonly practiced version of PT, and whether there are negative side effects of the integration due to less attention and time de-dicated to more traditional elements and procedures. Differential effects, moderators and mediators will be analyzed.The project is important if psychotherapy research is to cover “real practice” in an endeavor to reduce the much bemoa-ned science-practice gap.

Research is still in the early stages of investigating the specific relationships among diagnostic groups and defense mechanisms along with their response to different treatment types.  METHODS:  For the present study a total of 47 outpatients diagnosed with depression or anxiety disorders were randomized to receive 25±3 sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy with integrated elements of either emotion focused therapy (CBT + EFT) or treatment components based on self regulation theory (CBT + SR). An observer rated method the Defense Mechanism Rating Scale (DMRS) was used to code transcripts of the 1st 8th 16th and 24th session to assess change in defensive functioning.  RESULTS:  Over the course of therapy overall defensive functioning (ODF) as well as adaptive defenses increased significantly whereas maladaptive and neurotic defenses did not change. At the beginning of treatment the proportion of adaptive defenses and ODF was significantly higher in patients diagnosed with anxiety disorders than in patients with depressive disorders. However depressed patients exhibited greater improvement in their defensive functioning over the course of therapy.  CONCLUSIONS:  Results support the view of defense mechanisms as a useful transdiagnostic and transtheoretical concept and supports the notion that change of defense mechanisms may be a relevant mechanism of change in psychotherapy.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

SummaryFollicular Lymphoma (FL) is the most common form of indolent B-cell malignancies with a worldwide incidence of 120,000 new cases per year. Almost 40% of the indolent FL eventually transform into a more aggressive and highly proliferative tumor. FL is incurable with conventional chemotherapy and in the past years little therapeutic progresses have been made. The genetic hallmark of FL is the translocation t(14;18) that increases Bcl2 expression, but additional genetic alterations are required to induce lymphomagenesis and transformation (Kridel et al., 2012). Recently, several studies(Morin et al., 2011; Okosun et al., 2013; Pasqualucci et al., 2014) have catalogued genomic changes in FL based on their frequency. Looking forward, the next challenge will be to define the functional role of these genetic lesions in the lymphomagenesis and malignant progression, which is the strategic goal of this proposal. Deletions of chromosome 6q are frequent in FL and include several candidate genes. We used a functional genetic screenings to filter the large number of potential tumor suppressors in this region. The screening highlighted several candidates including EPHA7 (Oricchio et al., 2011), TNFAIP3 (Compagno et al., 2009), IBTK, FoxO3 and Sestrin1. These genes are frequently co-deleted, and the synergistic impact of these concurrent alterations in FL development is unknown.In our study we propose to: 1) Test the biological impact of frequent and concurrent loss of multiple candidate genes in FL initiation and transformation using genetically engineered mouse models of FL;2) Determine the signaling consequences of functionally implicated genomic alterations in lymphoma cells;3) Investigate the impact of recurrent functionally validated genetic alterations on responses (and resistance) to therapy. Specifically, we will focus on loss of FoxO3 and Sestrin1. These two genes are invariably concurrently lost, being in the same focally deleted region and they positively score in screening assays to identify possible tumor suppressor genes. Moreover, both FoxO3 and Sestrin1 are downstream effectors in the PI3K/Akt pathway (Budanov and Karin, 2008; Myatt and Lam, 2007). We will assess the signaling consequences of FoxO3 and Sestrin1 loss on the PI3K/Akt pathway and establish how their loss influences responses to chemotherapy and to specific PI3K, Akt and mTor inhibitors.This project will integrate genomic analyses with in vivo functional studies to explore inter-relationship between common genetic lesions in lymphoma, and then design and test in pre-clinical trials new mechanism-guided combinatorial therapies.",Institut suisse de recherche expérimentale sur le cancer EPFL SV ISREC,Lausanne,652356,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results",United States of America,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),Genetic and epigenetic inactivation of SESTRIN1 controls mTORC1 and response to EZH2 inhibition in follicular lymphoma,"Oricchio Elisa,  Katanayeva Natalya,  Donaldson Maria Christine,  Sungalee Stephanie,  Pasion Joyce P.,  Béguelin Wendy,  Battistello Elena,  Sanghvi Viraj R.,  Jiang Man,  Jiang Yanwen,  Teater Matt,  Parmigiani Anita,  Budanov Andrei V.,  Chan Fong Chun,  Shah Sohrab P.,  Kridel Robert,  Melnick Ari M.,  Ciriello Giovanni,  Wendel Hans-Guido",Published,2017,,10.1126/scitranslmed.aak9969,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5559734/,Science Translational Medicine,,Science Translational Medicine,9,396,eaak9969,eaak9969,Science Translational Medicine,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although DBS has led to very positive outcomes with regard to disease-specific symptoms and is generally not associated with major impairment of psychological state, quality of life surprisingly improves far less than expected for many patients, mechanisms of which are likely multiple and complex. Social and professional maladjustment, inappropriate expectations, inadequate attributions and strategies of coping have been raised by authors as possible causes, suggesting that premorbid and presurgical personality of patients could play a pivotal role in the perceived success or failure of treatment during the course of recovery. However, studies are scarce, results often contradictory and, due to the small number of DBS patients usually incorporated in research projects, generalization hardly possible. Thus, the aim of the present study is to thoroughly investigate the way psychological characteristics impact on quality of life in a large sample (N=115) of DBS patients.We plan to assess quality of life in 115 patients before and after (6, 12 and 18 months) DBS in this prospective and longitudinal study. Patients will be recruited at the Geneva University Hospitals, La Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris, and Henri Mondor Hospital in Créteil, France. A battery of psychological tests measuring quality of life (MOS SF-36), personality traits (NEO PI-R), illness’ causal attributions (IPQ-R), coping strategies (Brief COPE), marital relationship (MSS), depression (HADS) and mental health (MINI) will be administrated to each patient as well as his/her partner. Indeed, patients’ capacities to adapt to their new life situation after DBS are hypothesized to also depend on the psychological characteristics of their spouse, as well as the quality of their relationship. Covariates will include the patients’ level of cognitive functioning (Mattis), the presence of an attentional bias in emotion processing (EST), monitoring of additional life stressors over the longitudinal period of time (SRRS), as well as pre/post DBS changes in disease-specific symptoms.We expect that internal, controllable and adjustable attributions, flexible coping style, higher levels of the Extraversion and Openness to experience personality dimensions as well as better quality of marital relationship, and lower intensity of comorbid psychiatric diseases, anxiety and depression, will favor higher post-surgery quality of life. Whereas studies investigating the relations between DBS and personality are sparse, a better understanding of the way surgery impacts on the patients’ psychological characteristics and quality of life is pivotal to sharpen selection criteria, improve postoperative adaptation and minimize occurrence of adverse events.",Fondation de Nant Secteur psychiatrique de l'Est vaudois,Corsier-sur-Vevey,554820,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Research Infrastructures",Switzerland,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In Geneva, approximately 250 new CRC cases are diagnosed each year.Approximately 6% of CRC patients carry a strong inherited genetic predisposition to CRC. Lynch syndrome is the most common hereditary CRC syndrome characterized by germline mutations in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes. Up to 30% of CRC patients report having one or more relatives also diagnosed with the disease. Family history (FH) of CRC has been consistently associated with a two- to three-fold risk of CRC. However, how FH may affect CRC characteristics, management and outcome is not entirely elucidated. Overall, research into the relationship between FH and CRC at a population level is necessary for the comprehension of the disease predisposition.We plan to set up and maintain a population-based cohort of CRC patients and their first- (FDRs) and second-degree relatives (SDRs) in Geneva to:1.Assess the prevalence of FH of CRC (and of other cancer types) among CRC patients;2.Compare patient, tumor and management characteristics according to FH; 3.Investigate the risks of cancer in FDR and SDR of patients who had a diagnosis of CRC;4.Evaluate the uptake of genetic counseling among CRC patients with familial risk of CRC and the determinants of such a consultation process, as well as the impact of genetic counseling on survival.At the end of 2012, 6’222 CRC patients were registered in the Geneva Cancer Registry (GCR) database.

Children tend to blur the distinction between reality and imagination, and thus also show more MB. From a classical developmental psychological viewpoint, MB should dissipate with increasing age and sophisticated thinking abilities. Surveys, however, reveal that MB are common in Western adults (Knittel & Schetsche, 2012; Rice, 2003). Even when adults explicitly deny MB, laboratory experiments show that their behaviour implies that they consider anomalous interpretations of an event (Subbotsky & Quinteros, 2002; Subbotsky, 2004). Thus, both children and adults experience MB, varying widely for both groups in magnitude (Johnson & Harris, 1994; Subbotsky & Quinteros, 2002). If we want to fully understand human experience and behavior, we need to acknowledge that MB i) are central to many individuals and groups and ii) are of wide public interest. On these grounds, we are surprised about how little we know about MB formation, i.e. how they are formed, whether they are still formed in adulthood, and once acquired, whether they are stable over time. Currently, the predominant view in the scientific literature is that MB are established in early childhood, have a trait-like character, and reflect probable remnants from childhood. In the present proposal, we question these latter assumptions, in particular that all MB 1) are established in early life (developmental view) and 2) reflect stable and enduring (trait-like) thinking styles. Instead, we argue that MB can change with (and potentially be triggered by) actual life experiences in adulthood, and as such question the notion that they are trait-like thinking biases. We will perform experimental studies in which we expose individuals to anomalous events and investigate accompanying cognitive mechanisms that have formerly been associated with trait-like MB in healthy adults. We predict that cognitive mechanisms formerly associated with trait-like MB can also emerge (or become enhanced) when healthy adults experience events that cannot be explained by commonly available scientific explanations (magic tricks). We also predict that this emergence or enhancement is pronounced when we contextually reinforce non-scientific, psychic explanations. The current work has important theoretical and methodological implications: Our work offers insights into adult MB formation, i.e. that life events (experiencing anomalous events) could cause enhanced and, possibly even establish, MB. This work is not only new, but can become highly influential in the investigation of adult MB formation, due to its causal approach.",Institut de psychologie Université de Lausanne,Lausanne,507744,0000-0002-3720-7115,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Peer-reviewed,Review article (peer-reviewed),Magical Potential: Why Magic Performances Should be Used to Explore the Psychological Factors Contributing to Human Belief Formation,"Mohr Christine,  Lesaffre Lise,  Kuhn Gustav",Published,2019,,10.1007/s12124-018-9459-1,,Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science,,Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science,53,1,126,137,Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science,,Beliefs in supernatural entities are integral parts of both our culturally embedded religions and more individualized magical belief systems (e.g. paranormal beliefs spirituality). Scholars regularly link the occurrence of beliefs to individuals’ cognitive and affective ways of information processing. For magical beliefs in particular we expect children to endorse them. When reaching adulthood however individuals should have abandoned magical beliefs and become pragmatic sceptical critical and rational thinkers. The reality is a large proportion of the adult population can be described as magical thinkers or report having had magical experiences even in the recent past. Moreover psychological research in adults shows a large range of magical beliefs which correlate with particular psychological processing biases (e.g. repetition avoidance seeing signal in noise). Unfortunately these correlational studies do not tell us whether such psychological processing biases precede magical beliefs or whether they result from these magical beliefs. Knowing the direction of such relationships is key to understand which psychological biases might contribute to adult belief formation (or the persistence of beliefs from childhood). To test such causal relationships we started to systematically apply an experimental approach in which people are exposed to anomalous events. Such a central event allows before after comparisons of psychological biases. First empirical results confirmed that the use of magic performances particularly when of paranormal nature results in an important amount of paranormal explanations. Pre existing beliefs enhanced this explanation bias. These results show how easily naïve observers can be “tricked” into unsubstantiated beliefs.,162370,"Media relations: radio, television",Tribu - La magie et le réel,https://www.rts.ch/play/radio/tribu/audio/la-magie-et-le-reel?id=10256282,2019
