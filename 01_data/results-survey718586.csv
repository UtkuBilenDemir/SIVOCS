To my knowledge, it is not yet adopted by the industry. However, the concept has been taken up by other academic target groups. It requires some years of research to make improvements so that industry will be able to adopt it.","Although the primary project design was not to develop sensors for monitoring long COVID patients, one of the unexpected outcomes of the project has been using materials developed from the project in sensors to determine exhaled oxygen concentration in breathe of long-COVID patients (manuscript submitted to journal for consideration). This work was done in collaboration with a research group in India. This could not have been completely envisaged. I think in that way SNSF does a great job of funding fundamental science that could be useful for the public good. It has to be mentioned that this only comes about through collaboration.","","3643.09","28.12","","","","9.68","","157.16","","","","239.38","","","","79.4","","","","73.27","","","","106.58","","","","","","","89.14","","","2860.36","","","","","","Koushik","Venkatesan","koushik.venkatesan@mq.edu.au","548130","male","135488","Novel Organometallic Complexes and Polymers Based Luminescent Materials","Inorganic Chemistry","Project funding (Div.

These methods are now under evaluation by the Swiis nuclear industry to implement them in the control of effluents from the power plants and during nuclear dismentling. They are also under evaluation (and partly granted) by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health in the frame of the Environmental Radioactivity Survey Plan.  We also apply the methods in a project with a French NGO (ACRO) in the discovering of a former contamination of the environnent nearby the la Hague reprocessing plant.","FNS granted a companion study to this one and we are currently evaluating environmental contamination by radionuclides nearby the Sellafield reprocessing plant. We were able to evaluate for the first time the fluxes of Pu, A, and U from the contaminated sediments to the water. These data will be used in a new model of determining the radioactive dose to the public living in proximity of the plant. This defines eventually the sense of ""social innovation"" of our projects.","","4280.69","45.44","","","","12.95","","1259.67","","","","66.77","","","","115.38","","","","49.24","","","","159.02","","","","","","","67.31","","","2504.91","","","","","","Pascal","Froidevaux","pascal.froidevaux@chuv.ch","528290","male","140230","In situ speciation measurements and bioavailability determination of plutonium in natural waters of a karst system using diffusion in thin film technique (DGT)","Geochemistry","Project funding (Div.

It is a reason (beyond many others) to value both trans-disciplinary projects and fundamental approaches.","","One of the difficulty we met is the reluctance of many scholars to accept  to be ""disturbed"" in their routine research practices through the interaction with researchers coming from other disciplines, sub-disciplines, or frameworks. As a result, the risk is that a supposed inter-disciplinary project can turn out to be a juxtaposition of intra-disciplinary contribution. Public research foundations should be more aware of this risk and more mobilized to prevent it.","","2159.67","206.24","","","","7.71","","74.01","","","","179.96","","","","117.16","","","","59.82","","","","175.17","","","","","","","106.86","","","1232.74","","","","","","Jacques","Lévy","jacques.levy@epfl.ch","514259","male","147687","Post Car World","Social geography and ecology","Sinergia","2013-2017"

In this respect, our project is highly relevant, despite the fact that we mainly analyze historical sources through the lens of film, TV and literary narratives. Therefore, SNSF can only continue carefully to choose diverse projects in terms of theories, disciplines, research objectives and cultural/geohistorical contexts.","","When we started our HK project in 2004, Hong Kong was one of the most innovative urban communities. Despite still being under British colonial rule, the community thrived. Today, under PRC rulership, there is massive social unrest and insecurity, especially among the young population, about political participation, job opportunities and the future as a whole. To study the coming of age experience during the 1950s meant to us to understand how British colonial rule was gradually transformed into an accountable political system by the highly educated society. It seems that, with the Chinese decolonizers, HKers are led back to the ""roaring"" 1960s in some way or another. We did not expect this development and will carry on with our observation and analysis of cultural responses with regard to the special sociopolitical situation in HK.","","3057.42","23.38","","","","14.1","","59.97","","","","67.53","","","","63.44","","","","45.15","","","","113.12","","","","","","","89.96","","","2580.77","","","","","","Andrea","Riemenschnitter","andrea.riemenschnitter@aoi.uzh.ch","507754","female","153590","Coming of age in Hong Kong: a study of a colonial literary field in the 1950s","Other languages and literature","Project funding (Div.

This has potential impact in several areas:
(1) Development of genetic tests to eradicate a lethal disease from the dog population (--> animal welfare, business opportunity for commercial diagnostic laboratories)
(2) Improvement of the well being of the dogs' owners and breeders.
(3) Advance in basic knowledge on the function of genes, similar diseases might also affect human patients (rare diseases)","","","2306.61","14.99","","","","11.22","","17.93","","","","64.35","","","","164.82","","","","49.3","","","","173.96","","","","","","","102.28","","","1707.76","","","","","","Tosso","Leeb","tosso.leeb@vetsuisse.unibe.ch","528333","male","160738","A One Health Approach to unravel Novel Genes and Molecular Pathways in Dermatology","Dermatology","Sinergia","2015-2019"

The way that academia works nowadays, with projects submission and scholars desperately looking for secure jobs, creates a toxic atmosphere.

Probabilistic models to quantify the value of the evidence are developed, notably in what is now called the Bayesian framework (a way to reason and to decide under state of uncertainty). The project deals with a particular scientific information obtained through DNA analysis of stains recovered on crime scene. We dev eloped the model to interpret results but unfortunately the analytical (laboratory) technique to collect data in real cases has not been impelled in routine work. So, our probabilistic model was just an academic problem we solved. The results has been published and my Ph.D student was able to finish her research and to obtain a PhD in forensic science and statistics.","","","1236.97","43.39","","","","10.08","","46.92","","","","86.73","","","","101.31","","","","55.38","","","","240.91","","","","","","","101.69","","","550.56","","","","","","Franco","Taroni","franco.taroni@unil.ch","78068","male","156146","Further challenges arising from the evaluation of results of a novel DNA marker system","Legal sciences","Project funding (Div.

The project was stopped by SNF on the basis of the referee reports: 2 were excellent, one was positive but put a sentence putting the doubt that our institute is too small for such a project. On the base of this doubt SNF stopped the project but financed the finishing of the PhD student project.
It was nevertheless possible to form a postdoc who is now continuing working in science and a PhD student who brilliantly finished with a new topic.

Social innovation should be clearly stated in the broader impact section or in a dedicated section of SNSF proposals. This would both promote social innovation and make scientists more aware of various aspects of social innovation. In fact, most scientific projects promote social innovation even if scientists might not always be fully aware of it. This is a missed opportunity for both science and society. In order to inspire scientists to promote social innovation with their projects, various examples of social innovation could be illustrated on the SNSF website and various workshops and webinars could be organized with teams of experts. Social innovation should not be perceived by scientists as an obligation but as an opportunity and an added value. In fact, proposals should not be penalized if social innovation is not adequately addressed. However, in case of acceptance of the project, examples of social-innovation activities could be proposed to the PIs by a team of SNSF experts.","For both my two lines of research (dispersal and sedimentation of volcanic particles and assessment of volcanic risk) I found that operational agencies and decision makers were more inclined to implement scientific innovation in their policies if they were actively involved in project publication and/or organization of dedicated workshops instead of just being informed of the project results.
Local workshops also worked very well to engage with various local groups (e.g. general public, stake holders, decision makers). In fact, through these workshops various social groups felt more empowered and motivated to increase their preparedness to face natural hazards. 
","What I did not full expect from the social innovation of my projects is how the engagement we had at the local level (e.g. workshops, interviews, informal discussions) actually triggered spontaneous activities in the local community and favoured interaction amongst various social groups that otherwise would not have happened. 
I was also positively surprised by how international scientists that were invited to the local workshops could appreciate the importance of sharing project results with the local communities, which is not common practice in our scientific community.

- In collaboration with the Bioscope in Geneva, we have built teaching modules (https://scienscope.unige.ch/bioscope/ateliers/atelier-15/ and https://scienscope.unige.ch/bioscope/ateliers/atelier-14/) for kids and adolescents.
- We have also published a brochure explaining the importance of sleep for physical and mental health and how to preserve sleep. This brochure is used by teachers, and health practitioners (school nurses and physicians).","I found that several of the items proposed in the survey were not easy to assess. This is due partly to the fact that the SNF project selected is related to a set of other research projects and surveys that we have been and are still currently conducting in the lab, and which pertain to the impact of sleep curtailment in various populations (from kids to adults) and caused by the use of smartphones etc. In addition, the selected project uncovers neuroscience mechanisms underlying memory consolidation occurring during sleep. As such, it provides scientific evidence advocating for the crucial role of sleep in learning, academic achievement, etc. which we have also been assessing in other projects through collection of data in schools etc. In other words, the social innovation value of this project cannot be evaluated separately from others companion projects.","","3597.08","35.36","","","","11.07","","85.94","","","","87.83","","","","174.77","","","","85.7","","","","277","","","","","","","88.04","","","2751.37","","","","","","Sophie","Schwartz","sophie.schwartz@unige.ch","86230","female","159862","Memory reactivation across distinct vigilance states: A multimodal neural decoding approach in humans","Neurophysiology and Brain Research","Project funding (Div.

It is a text book and rather unique  example of quantum mechanics operating at macroscopic scales. The collaboration involved considerable travel to Japan for collaborative work and as such generated considerable cross-cultural interest. The collaboration with theorists allowed to understand the great impact  of this research and possible extensions in other physics experiments using very different techniques (colliders).  We organized several public events with full auditoriums including young children and their parents, older people of all social classes asking absolutely fantastic questions.

A key contribution of our project is to provide a genetic basis to define essential functions of this family of proteases during development and now in cancer. Probably the greatest surprise is our finding how Furin regulates the activation of key substrates such as Activin-A in a far more complex multistep cascade involving several additional proteases and Activin-interacting factors that includes novel potentially druggable targets. My reservation about this survey is that it reflects a ""world view"" where societal impact seems to be measured nowadays by the level of media noise (and hype) that is created by individual players, even if such noise is just that: Noise.","","3914.19","238.45","","","","25.92","","31.13","","","","208.32","","","","144.32","","","","67.27","","","","748.44","","","","","","","122.85","","","2327.49","","","","","","Daniel","Constam","daniel.constam@epfl.ch","56543","male","156452","Functional analysis of proprotein convertases in development and cancer","Embryology, Developmental Biology","Project funding (Div.

We studied young adults affected by ADHD, a population that is often left away from the studies (that are mainly focused on children and adolescents). However, adults affected by ADHD might represent up to 5-8% of the population.  We show that a cognitive task called ""Dual n-back task"" has a reliable effect. The Dual n-back task in the adaptive mode offers as a promising candidate for a cognitive remediation of adult ADHD patients without pharmaceutical medication.

This research provides a narrative that exposes the very restricted view that most humans have of sexuality. While evolution has led to the emergence of two fundamental sexual strategies, namely making many small germ cells (the male sexual strategy) or making fewer large germ cells (the female sexual strategy), these do not always map onto (lifelong) male and female individuals. Instead, these fundamental strategies can be expressed by the same individual, either sequentially (in sex changing organisms) or at the same time (in simultaneous hermaphrodites). Our research has documented extensive quantitative variation in the amounts allocated to the male and female side of a simultaneous hermaphrodite, and identified important predictors of this variation.","It is fundamental research that has provided the basis for human development and advancement. Moreover, it is fundamental research that has identified most of the serious problems that humanity is currently facing.","","2150.25","22.83","","","","15.78","","30.23","","","","104.17","","","","110.72","","","","59.55","","","","107.29","","","","","","","74.76","","","1624.92","","","","","","Lukas","Schärer","lukas.scharer@unibas.ch","118368","male","162543","Evolution of Sex Allocation and its Correlates in Simultaneous Hermaphrodites","Genetics","Project funding (Div.

More interviews with the SNSF funded researchers.
To report and remark all forms of innovations such as patents, technology transfer, licensing, spin-offs, etc. reflecting the practical significance of SNSF funded projects as well as scientific achievements.
To introduce a form of SNSF award for the different groups and categories of researchers per year (even without any monetary expression) - just an honour and recognition. This will surely stimulate social innovation and awareness of society about these achievements. 
In brief, many forms can be imagined and brainstormed. I am open to contribute and discuss.
","Yes, sure. 
In brief, we work on anti-counterfeiting solutions to protect brands and life-/health-critical products agains counterfeiting.
We fairly evaluate the security of existing methods and propose new methods, provide public datasets and open codes for that.
You can find more details on:
http://sip.unige.ch/projects/snf-it-dis/about-project/
I will be glad to provide more detailed description, if you have some special format/template for that.","Yes, the main surprising result is that how vulnerable are modern supply chains and our society in view of advanced counterfeiting that might impact our economy and public security. This calls for a need of stronger collaboration between policy makers and technology providers as well as an increase of societal awareness and readiness to deploy the anticouterfeiting solutions.","","5137.93","27.3","","","","7.78","","33.15","","","","43.86","","","","116.34","","","","40.18","","","","840.41","","","","","","","2243.36","","","1785.55","","","","","","Sviatoslav","Voloshynovskiy","svolos@unige.ch","104535","male","165672","Information-theoretic forensic physical object identification","Information Technology","Project funding (Div.

I feel that often such projects, in order to really reach impact in the society, would benefit of further sponsoring continuity, 3-4 years being a too short term. In my research area, they also typically involve a lot of engineering (as opposed to research/science) and a stronger support of engineering staff would be welcome, of course in addition to the great one already made available by the SNSF for PhD students and postdoctoral fellows. This would certainly serve as great incentive to go after such projects which have, according to my experience, a lower scientific impact than their more fundamental research counterpart, especially when normalized with the overall effort invested in the project.

Finally, last but not least, I think SNSF surveys are great initiatives, but this period of the year is unavoidably overbooked and surveys of any type tend be put at the bottom of the list ... .
I therefore apologize for the late submission of my feedback, I hope you will still be able to take it into consideration.","","3890.35","28.39","","","","30.61","","49.59","","","","115.34","","","","147.2","","","","82.42","","","","503.25","","","","","","","113.71","","","2819.84","","","","","","Alcherio","Martinoli","alcherio.martinoli@epfl.ch","68289","male","160726","A Flexible Underwater Distributed Robotic System for High-Resolution Sensing of Aquatic Ecosystems","Other disciplines of Engineering Sciences","Sinergia","2015-2019"
