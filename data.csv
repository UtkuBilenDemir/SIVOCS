In this respect, our project is highly relevant, despite the fact that we mainly analyze historical sources through the lens of film, TV and literary narratives. Therefore, SNSF can only continue carefully to choose diverse projects in terms of theories, disciplines, research objectives and cultural/geohistorical contexts.","","When we started our HK project in 2004, Hong Kong was one of the most innovative urban communities. Despite still being under British colonial rule, the community thrived. Today, under PRC rulership, there is massive social unrest and insecurity, especially among the young population, about political participation, job opportunities and the future as a whole. To study the coming of age experience during the 1950s meant to us to understand how British colonial rule was gradually transformed into an accountable political system by the highly educated society. It seems that, with the Chinese decolonizers, HKers are led back to the ""roaring"" 1960s in some way or another. We did not expect this development and will carry on with our observation and analysis of cultural responses with regard to the special sociopolitical situation in HK.",NA

Social innovation should be clearly stated in the broader impact section or in a dedicated section of SNSF proposals. This would both promote social innovation and make scientists more aware of various aspects of social innovation. In fact, most scientific projects promote social innovation even if scientists might not always be fully aware of it. This is a missed opportunity for both science and society. In order to inspire scientists to promote social innovation with their projects, various examples of social innovation could be illustrated on the SNSF website and various workshops and webinars could be organized with teams of experts. Social innovation should not be perceived by scientists as an obligation but as an opportunity and an added value. In fact, proposals should not be penalized if social innovation is not adequately addressed. However, in case of acceptance of the project, examples of social-innovation activities could be proposed to the PIs by a team of SNSF experts.","For both my two lines of research (dispersal and sedimentation of volcanic particles and assessment of volcanic risk) I found that operational agencies and decision makers were more inclined to implement scientific innovation in their policies if they were actively involved in project publication and/or organization of dedicated workshops instead of just being informed of the project results.
Local workshops also worked very well to engage with various local groups (e.g. general public, stake holders, decision makers). In fact, through these workshops various social groups felt more empowered and motivated to increase their preparedness to face natural hazards. 
","What I did not full expect from the social innovation of my projects is how the engagement we had at the local level (e.g. workshops, interviews, informal discussions) actually triggered spontaneous activities in the local community and favoured interaction amongst various social groups that otherwise would not have happened. 
I was also positively surprised by how international scientists that were invited to the local workshops could appreciate the importance of sharing project results with the local communities, which is not common practice in our scientific community.

Whereas the results were promising (basically providing proof-of-concept) and the company was also interested, the second stage of the project (submitted with commitment from the company) did not receive funding from SNF. 

Whereas we still believe that this specific drug/drug target could bring a clinical benefit for this still poorly treatable disease entity, the small scale of the project and marginal financing led to delay in project completion (publication currently pending) and hindered its translation to societal impact.

A key contribution of our project is to provide a genetic basis to define essential functions of this family of proteases during development and now in cancer. Probably the greatest surprise is our finding how Furin regulates the activation of key substrates such as Activin-A in a far more complex multistep cascade involving several additional proteases and Activin-interacting factors that includes novel potentially druggable targets. My reservation about this survey is that it reflects a ""world view"" where societal impact seems to be measured nowadays by the level of media noise (and hype) that is created by individual players, even if such noise is just that: Noise.",NA

We studied young adults affected by ADHD, a population that is often left away from the studies (that are mainly focused on children and adolescents). However, adults affected by ADHD might represent up to 5-8% of the population.  We show that a cognitive task called ""Dual n-back task"" has a reliable effect. The Dual n-back task in the adaptive mode offers as a promising candidate for a cognitive remediation of adult ADHD patients without pharmaceutical medication.

This research provides a narrative that exposes the very restricted view that most humans have of sexuality. While evolution has led to the emergence of two fundamental sexual strategies, namely making many small germ cells (the male sexual strategy) or making fewer large germ cells (the female sexual strategy), these do not always map onto (lifelong) male and female individuals. Instead, these fundamental strategies can be expressed by the same individual, either sequentially (in sex changing organisms) or at the same time (in simultaneous hermaphrodites). Our research has documented extensive quantitative variation in the amounts allocated to the male and female side of a simultaneous hermaphrodite, and identified important predictors of this variation.","It is fundamental research that has provided the basis for human development and advancement.

To report and remark all forms of innovations such as patents, technology transfer, licensing, spin-offs, etc. reflecting the practical significance of SNSF funded projects as well as scientific achievements.
To introduce a form of SNSF award for the different groups and categories of researchers per year (even without any monetary expression) - just an honour and recognition. This will surely stimulate social innovation and awareness of society about these achievements. 
In brief, many forms can be imagined and brainstormed. I am open to contribute and discuss.
","Yes, sure. 
In brief, we work on anti-counterfeiting solutions to protect brands and life-/health-critical products agains counterfeiting.
We fairly evaluate the security of existing methods and propose new methods, provide public datasets and open codes for that.
You can find more details on:

I will be glad to provide more detailed description, if you have some special format/template for that.","Yes, the main surprising result is that how vulnerable are modern supply chains and our society in view of advanced counterfeiting that might impact our economy and public security.

I feel that often such projects, in order to really reach impact in the society, would benefit of further sponsoring continuity, 3-4 years being a too short term. In my research area, they also typically involve a lot of engineering (as opposed to research/science) and a stronger support of engineering staff would be welcome, of course in addition to the great one already made available by the SNSF for PhD students and postdoctoral fellows. This would certainly serve as great incentive to go after such projects which have, according to my experience, a lower scientific impact than their more fundamental research counterpart, especially when normalized with the overall effort invested in the project.

Finally, last but not least, I think SNSF surveys are great initiatives, but this period of the year is unavoidably overbooked and surveys of any type tend be put at the bottom of the list ... .
I therefore apologize for the late submission of my feedback, I hope you will still be able to take it into consideration.",NA
