Now we live in the “great experiment” era of central banks in which a plethora of “code red” policies such as QE, zero interest rates, large-scale asset purchases (leading to de facto currency “wars” and their potential debasement) are being put forward, one after another, without any certainty about the social and economic consequences that these policies might bring about. The “great experiment” will likely continue for one, perhaps two or even more decades (in different forms) as in the Japanese scenario, and many new bubbles in part fuelled by these policies are likely to emerge. In this context filled with uncertainty, the central role of the real estate market during the 2008 financial crisis and the systemic risks that the market carries has crystalized a number of important research questions, while obliging to revisit others issues from the past. In this proposal, our guiding post will be the questions raised by Hansen (2012) and Brunnermeier and Oehmke (2012) in their respective surveys about systemic risk and bubbles, which resonate directly with our own research agenda. Specifically, this research will address four significant questions: 1) How do real estate bubbles emerge and how do they deflate? 2) How do real estate bubbles propagate internationally and what are their linkages with booms and bubbles in other assets? 3) How agent behaviors, their interaction, and their expectations influence real estate bubbles in the context of financial frictions? 4) How can we characterize and possibly mitigate the systemic risk of real estate bubbles in the economy?We will approach these questions with the view, which lies at the core of all research conducted by our group, that the origin of crashes is much more subtle than is often thought, as it is constructed progressively by the market as a whole, as an endogenous self-organizing process. In this sense, the true cause of a crash could be termed a systemic instability and any analysis of the market ought to consider the economy as a complex and dynamic system. Methodologically, we intend to follow a Bayesian approach, which will allow us to study multiple theories and to combine standard macroeconomic research with our understanding of economic systems. We will integrate macroeconomic financial frictions into nonlinear dynamic models that allow for different types of interactions among heterogeneous agents (i.e. varying dependence structures), endogenous risks, and analysis of out-of-equilibrium dynamics. Our empirical research will encompass developing and advanced economies to obtain a comprehensive view of the international real estate markets and to avoid the possible misinterpretations that could result from looking at real markets from the sole lenses of the advanced economies. Furthermore, we will maintain an archeological approach to the data; exploring and contrasting several models while applying statistical learning techniques to allow the data to speak by itself. The outcome of this research will not only nurture the scientific debate in traditional academic venues. The systemic risk indicators that we will develop will also feed the Financial Crisis Observatory and the Real Estate Observatory. Both initiatives are under development by our group at ETH Zurich, and are publicly available platforms that aim to inform the general public, and serve as scientific tools to analyze complex economic and financial systems.

In 2008, Swiss firms spent 57 per cent of their R&D abroad, whereas German firms spent 18 per cent abroad (OECD, 2015a, b)-a figure similar to the United States (NSF, 2010). In a similar vein, cooperation with partners located across the globe is becoming a central element of an ever-increasing internationalisation, and integration, of knowledge activities (OECD, 2008; Keller, 2004). From a theoretical viewpoint, the globalisation of R&D makes the R&D process more efficient. It allows firms to access a pool of qualified engineers when national talents become scarce. As knowledge spillovers are highly localised, firms seek to tap into frontier technologies worldwide by setting up R&D labs in technology clusters. Yet, despite the topicality of the theme, and the growing literature and data, we still poorly understand the antecedents and effects of firms’ decisions to internationalise their R&D activities.The proposed project aims to improve our understanding of the causes and consequences of the globalisation of knowledge activities. It makes three main contributions to the scientific literature: 1) identification and evolution of technology clusters worldwide; 2) factors that drive firms to internationalise their knowledge activities into such clusters; and 3) risk and performance effects of diversifying knowledge activities into international knowledge clusters. In order to pursue our research goals, we make use of novel data. We use worldwide patent data to map the evolution of technology clusters worldwide. We then use patent data matched with ‘R&D top investors’ worldwide (short panel) and representative firm-level survey data from Switzerland and Germany (20-year panel) as the basis for econometric analyses of the research questions. As for the policy relevance of the project, some policy makers are worried that R&D offshoring may hollow out the national innovative capacity. The project will shed light on the extent to which R&D offshoring and other activities lead to productivity improvement at home and the conditions under which such improvement arise.

Despite the relevance of these processes at the individual and societal levels, little is known about the neurobiological mechanisms that regulate their expression. Brain energy metabolism has been proposed to play a key role in brain function; however, knowledge about its link with specific brain functions and behaviors is still missing.Increasing evidence, including data from our own lab, implicates the nucleus accumbens and dopaminergic function in the regulation of motivated behaviors, including willingness to work for a reinforcer and rank acquisition in social competition; however, the neurobiological mechanism involved in the regulation of these behaviors are largely unknown. Our ongoing work in rodents has revealed marked differences in various markers of mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens -including among other parameters mitochondrial respiration- in rats differing in anxiety trait and in both their probability to win a dominance context and the amount of work they are willing to exert to obtain a food reinforcer under stress. Interfering with mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens impaired social dominance behaviors. These data strongly suggest a role for energy metabolism in the nucleus accumbens in the regulation of motivated behaviors and their modulation by stress. To date, knowledge about the role of energy metabolism per se (in specific brain regions, and particularly) in the nucleus accumbens is missing. We hypothesize that: (1) Differences in energy metabolism in the nucleus accumbens are causally implicated in the regulation of motivated behaviors, particularly in the outcome of a social competition and in the exertion of effortful behavior to obtain reward. (2) This involvement of nucleus accumbens energy metabolism is particularly revealed under the influence of stress. (3) Stress-induced modulation of nucleus accumbens energy metabolism involves an action through glucocorticoid receptors. (4) This involvement of nucleus accumbens energy metabolism in motivated behaviors operates in interaction with dopaminergic function. (5) Differences in energy metabolism in the nucleus accumbens are related to differential vulnerability in the emergence of stress-induced depression-like behaviors.This projects aims at testing these hypotheses by using behavioral, imaging, genetic, neurobiological, optogenetic and neuropharmacological techniques, and by means of pursuing the following objectives: 1.To establish the link between energy metabolism in the nucleus accumbens and motivated behaviors and its modulation by stress.2.To investigate the impact of acute stress in motivated behaviors and to explore the role of glucocorticoids.3.To prove the causal involvement of energy metabolism in the nucleus accumbens on motivated behavior. 4.To investigate the modulatory role of dopamine on the link between energy metabolism in the nucleus accumbens and motivated behavior.5.To establish the link between individual differences in nucleus accumbens energy metabolism and/or motivated behaviors with the development of stress-induced depression-like behaviors.We expect to obtain novel and important findings that will critically contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms that regulate motivated behaviors and vulnerability to develop depression. We also expect our findings to provide important information for the development of therapeutic approaches (e.g., pharmacological, behavioral, nutritional) to prevent or treat motivation- and/or stress-related psychopathologies.",503316,0000-0001-7713-8321,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",Switzerland,01.04.2014,30.04.2017,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),Mitochondrial function in the brain links anxiety with social subordination,"Hollis Fiona,  van der Kooij Michael A.,  Zanoletti Olivia,  Lozano Laura,  Cantó Carles,  Sandi Carmen",Published,2015,,10.1073/pnas.1512653112,https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/213846,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,,50,15486,15491,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,,Dominance hierarchies are integral aspects of social groups yet whether personality traits may predispose individuals to a particular rank remains unclear. Here we show that trait anxiety directly influences social dominance in male outbred rats and identify an important mediating role for mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens. High anxious animals that are prone to become subordinate during a social encounter with a low anxious rat exhibit reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity as well as decreased ATP and increased ROS production in the nucleus accumbens. A causal link for these findings is indicated by pharmacological approaches. In a dyadic contest between anxiety matched animals microinfusion of specific mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors into the nucleus accumbens reduced social rank mimicking the low probability to become dominant observed in high anxious animals. Conversely intraaccumbal infusion of nicotinamide an amide form of vitamin B3 known to enhance brain energy metabolism prevented the development of a subordinate status in high anxious individuals. We conclude that mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens is crucial for social hierarchy establishment and is critically involved in the low social competitiveness associated with high anxiety. Our findings highlight a key role for brain energy metabolism in social behavior and point to mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens as a potential marker and avenue of treatment for anxiety related social disorders.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Low trans. involvement - High public outcome,NA,60ies,e,4,Y,NA,NA,10,8,10,2,Y,NA,NA,Y,NA,NA,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,contr,contr,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,N,N,8,10,0,0,0,0,10,und,beh,NA,NA,NA,NA,beh,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,1,1,1,1,9,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,10,8,8

MDMA releases serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) by interacting with the respective monoamine transporters. DA is implicated in the addictive properties of drugs of abuse and DA and NE possible also in drug-induced euphoria. 5-HT mediates many of the acute effects of MDMA. However, it is not clear whether DA/NE transporter (SLC6A3/2)-mediated DA/NE release contributes to the acute effects of MDMA in humans. In addition, marked interindividual differences exist in the euphoric response to psychostimulants and in the risk of developing drug addiction and polymorphisms in gens that code for monoamine transporters and receptors are likely to critically contribute to interindividual variations in the response to amphetamines including MDMA. Furthermore, MDMA is primarily metabolized by the polymorphic CYP 2D6 enzyme. Variance in the CYP2D6 geno- and phenotype may therefore be associated with interindividual differences in plasma concentrations and associated toxicity produced by MDMA. Aim: We aim to evaluate the role of the DA/NET transporter and genetic polymorphism in monoamine transporters/receptors and different CYPs including CYP2D6 in the human pharmacology and toxicology of MDMA. Method: In study 1, we will investigate the effects of a pretreatment with the DA/NE transporter inhibitor bupropion on the acute effects of MDMA in 16 healthy subjects using a randomized placebo-controlled four-period factorial study design. The primary hypothesis is that bupropion will reduce the positive mood effects of MDMA. Secondary outcomes include cardiovascular effects, emotion recognition, empathic effects, pupillometry, and neuroendocrine effects, pharmacokinetics of MDMA, and adverse effects. Failure to demonstrate inhibition of the response to MDMA by bupropion would support 5-HT as the primary mediator. After the completion of study 1 the data will be pooled with all our previous comprehensive clinical data to form a large and worldwide unique cohort of MDMA-treated subjects (N=142). In study 2 we will then analyze associations between the response to MDMA and genetic polymorphisms and haplotypes in transporter/receptors involved in monoaminergic neurotransmission in this pooled sample and in an international larger sample (N=222). All subjects will also be tested for CYP2D6 pheno- and CYP2D6/2C19/2B6/1A2 genotypes involved in the metabolism of MDMA. Significance: This is the first study to investigate the role of the DA transporter in the mechanism of action of MDMA in humans. It is also the first pharmacogenetic study to assess the contribution of genetic variations in the monaminergic system to the effects of MDMA. Worldwide, there are no similarly large cohorts that would allow for the testing of these associations including also CYP pheno- and genotype data. The study will contribute to our understanding of the role of DA/NE vs. SERT and in particular the genetic determinants underlying the interindividual differences in the effects of amphetamine-like substances.",511445,,Publication,Great Britain and Northern Ireland,01.10.2013,30.09.2016,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),Development and validation of a rapid turboflow LC-MS/MS method for the quantification of LSD and 2-oxo-3-hydroxy LSD in serum and urine samples of emergency toxicological cases,"Dolder Patrick C.,  Liechti Matthias E.,  Rentsch Katharina M.",Published,2015,,10.1007/s00216-014-8388-1,http://edoc.unibas.ch/42281/,ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY,,ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY,407,6,1577,1584,ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY,,Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a widely used recreational drug. The aim of the present study is to develop a quantitative turboflow LC MS/MS method that can be used for rapid quantification of LSD and its main metabolite 2 oxo 3 hydroxy LSD (O H LSD) in serum and urine in emergency toxicological cases without time consuming extraction steps. The method was developed on an ion trap LC MS/MS instrument coupled to a turbulent flow extraction system. The validation data showed no significant matrix effects and no ion suppression has been observed in serum and urine. Mean intraday accuracy and precision for LSD were 101 and 6.84 in urine samples and 97.40 and 5.89 in serum respectively. For O H LSD the respective values were 97.50 and 4.99 in urine and 107 and 4.70 in serum. Mean interday accuracy and precision for LSD were 100 and 8.26 in urine and 101 and 6.56 in serum respectively. For O H LSD the respective values were 101 and 8.11 in urine and 99.8 and 8.35 in serum respectively. The lower limit of quantification for LSD was determined to be 0.1 ng/ml. LSD concentrations in serum were expected to be up to 8 ng/ml. 2 Oxo 3 hydroxy LSD concentrations in urine up to 250 ng/ml. The new method was accurate and precise in the range of expected serum and urine concentrations in patients with a suspected LSD intoxication. Until now the method has been applied in five cases with suspected LSD intoxication where the intake of the drug has been verified four times with LSD concentrations in serum in the range of 1.80 14.70 ng/ml and once with a LSD concentration of 1.25 ng/ml in urine. In serum of two patients the O H LSD concentration was determined to be 0.99 and 0.45 ng/ml.

Due to the high affinity of folic acid to these FRs this vitamin has been used as a targeting ligand for the selective delivery of attached imaging or therapeutic probes to diseased sites. Among FR-targeted therapeutics folate conjugates of highly toxic chemotherapeutics are successfully employed in clinical trials in the United States. As an imaging agent the SPECT tracer 99mTc-EC20 has been used for identification of patients with FR-positive malignancies.Status of Own Research: In the last decade we synthesized and evaluated a large number of folate radioconjugates for potential application in diagnostic nuclear medicine. For a therapeutic application, the high uptake of radioactivity in the kidneys is a major drawback as it comprises the risk of damage to the kidneys. Recently, we designed a novel folic acid radioconjugate (177Lu-cm09) with an albumin-binding entity to enhance the blood circulation time. It resulted in a significantly increased tumor uptake while retention in the kidneys was reduced. Thanks to this improved tumor-to-kidney ratio, it was possible for the first time to perform a preclinical study in mice in which folic acid was successfully employed for targeted radionuclide tumor therapy. The results were impressive with regard to the significant tumor growth delay and increased survival in treated mice compared to untreated controls. Goal of the Project: The goal of this project is the development of a second generation of theragnostic folate radioconjugates which are selective for the tumor-associated FR-alpha but which do not accumulate at sites of inflammation (FR-beta). This should be achieved by using reduced folates such as 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate (5-Me-THF) instead of folic acid as a targeting ligand because of its known (50-fold increased) binding preference for the FR-alpha. For evaluation of these novel radioconjugates, new mouse models will be developed which combine cancer and inflammtion. The second goal of this project is the optimization of FR-targeted radionuclide therapy by designing novel albumin-binding folate radioconjugates with improved pharmacokinetics. Clinically more relevant tumor mouse models with “metastases-like” intraperitoneal tumors will be developed and used for testing the most promising candidate among the novel radioconjugates.Expected Value of the Proposal: The clinically implemented concept of peptide receptor targeted radionuclide therapy (e.g. 177Lu-DOTATATE) shows impressive results for the palliative treatment of cancer patients providing a significantly improved quality of life with long progression-free survival even in cases with advanced tumors. Application of a tumor-selective folate radioconjugate for nuclear imaging would allow unambiguous identification of patients with FR-positive malignancies who may undergo FR-targeted (radio)therapy. Due to the large number of patients who could benefit from a FR-targeted radionuclide therapy, it is of critical interest to optimize this concept. Clinical translation of FR-targeted nuclear imaging and radionuclide therapy is the long-term future goal of this project. Realization of this vision would comprise an enormous potential for a better management of cancer diseases such as ovarian cancer or lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer deaths in Switzerland and other Western countries.

Targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) on the other hand is a systemic radiation therapy which makes use of intravenously applied radioconjugates. In this project it was aimed to perform an initial dose searching study for the combination of these treatment modalities in a preclinical setting. Therapy studies were performed with xenograft mouse models of folate receptor (FR) positive KB and prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positive PC 3 PIP tumors respectively. PT and TRT using 177Lu folate and 177Lu PSMA 617 respectively were applied either as single treatments or in combination. Monitoring of the mice over nine weeks revealed a similar tumor growth delay after PT and TRT respectively when equal tumor doses were delivered either by protons or by β¯ particles respectively. Combining the methodologies to provide half dose by either therapy approach resulted in equal (PC 3 PIP tumor model) or even slightly better therapy outcomes (KB tumor model). In separate experiments preclinical positron emission tomography (PET) was performed to investigate tissue activation after proton irradiation of the tumor. The high precision radiation delivery of PT was confirmed by the resulting PET images that accurately visualized the irradiated tumor tissue. In this study the combination of PT and TRT resulted in an additive effect or a trend of synergistic effects depending on the type of tumor xenograft. This study laid the foundation for future research regarding therapy options in the situation of metastasized solid tumors where surgery or PT alone are not a solution but may profit from combination with systemic radiation therapy.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Low trans. involvement - High public outcome,7,40ies,d,4,Y,NA,NA,4,5,6,1,NA,NA,NA,Y,NA,NA,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,colla,contr,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,Y,N,7,3,3,4,1,1,6,other,awar,other,awar,NA,NA,und,Changing the options of cancer treatment of patients and their quality of life.,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,0,4,1,4,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,5,2,2

One of the main drivers for the development of composites has been the need for stiff and light materials. More recently, the development of composite materials took advantage of the possibility to combine the traditional load-bearing functions of these materials with novel functionality in the composite part. Adaptive or 'smart' composite materials thus integrate actuators and sensors and can 'react' to their service environment, and enable gains in efficiency not only by reducing structural weight, but by integrating functions directly into the structure. These integrated functional components may act during process, during part preparation, and during service, either to adapt to the service conditions, or to detect damage and even to effect repair of the structure in service. In parallel, an increased range of applications in the composite field is linked to the development of cost-effective manufacturing processes that do not necessitate long processing time and expensive autoclaves. Liquid Composite Moulding (LCM) techniques, whereby a dry fabric is infiltrated by the liquid resin and then cured to form the part, are thus strong candidates, but one potential hurdle remains the lack of toughness of the resin in the materials thus produced, making them even more sensitive to damage.The present proposal is a continuation of an ongoing research effort on the development of Active Sensing and Repair Composites, which are manufactured by Liquid Composite Molding and integrate healing agents to repair damage, shape memory alloy wires to close cracks and if needed locally heat-up the healing systems, and fiber optic sensors to detect and localize damage. Emphasis is placed on the development of the combination of adapted materials and process windows to produce these composite parts by LCM techniques, and on the quantification of these materials response to damage, and to subsequent healing. Several healing systems are investigated: capsules containing a solvent, epoxy and amines, or a thermoplastic polymer in discrete form.

This scientific approach allows for a better understanding of the relationship between timeline land-usage and its impact on the health and structure of the ecosystem. Analyses of the chemical, isotopic, and biological composition of sediments provide clues on the past environmental conditions of a particular ecosystem. Lake sediments not only contain fossil organic and inorganic matter but also a variety of microorganisms that can be used as biological indicators for paleoecological studies. In order to be useful as a tracer, a paleoecological proxy, an organism, or at least a recognizable structure or chemical and isotopic composition linked to it (e.g. pollen grains or tests), must be preserved in sediments for long periods of time. While the mineralogical, chemical, and isotopic composition of sediments has been successfully used as a tracer of the paleoecological and paleoenvironmental conditions, bacterial endospores have only recently been examined as such tracers.  Bacterial endospores are highly specialized cellular forms that allow bacterial groups able to produce them to tolerate harsh environmental conditions while conserving their genetic information. This type of structure has been reported only for Firmicutes (Gram-positive low G+C content bacteria). Because spores are able to survive in a dormant state for extended periods of time, these cellular forms can also be considered as potential proxies for paleoecological and paleoenvironmental studies of sediment samples. In the past several years specific molecular methods have been developed that allows for the study of endospore-forming Firmicutes in a culture-independent manner. This is a major advantage because cultivation is a highly biased methodological approach, since it requires the revival of the dormant microorganism, and in many cases the conditions to achieve this are unknown. In particular, the genetic markers that can be used to study endospore-forming bacteria directly from environmental samples have been identified. The gene encoding for the master regulator of the genetic cascade leading to endospore formation (spo0A) has proven to be a specific molecular marker for this bacterial group. Using this molecular approach a correlation between community structure in sediment and the paleolimnological history of Lake Geneva has been demonstrated. Variations in community structure can be linked to eutrophication, sulfate metabolism or changes in the inputs of terrestrial organic matter, which in turn may be related to changes in climate. A treatment allowing the separation of endospores from vegetative cells and the sequencing of the endospore fraction allows to assess the effect of disturbance on active versus dormant populations in response to changes in environmental conditions. This information, in addition to that obtained from the more “classical” approach of using the mineralogical, chemical, and isotopic composition (carbon, nitrogen and/or oxygen of organic matter and inorganic carbonate or phosphatic fossil material) can be used in conjunction so as to improve and refine the paleoecological interpretations. The aim of this proposal is to validate the application of this novel approach of using endospores, in comparison to other complimentary methods used for paleoecological and paleoenvironmental interpretations of aquatic systems. For this three specific objectives will be set: i) to validate the use of endospores in comparison to more traditional biological proxies; ii) to evaluate the potential of generalizing the combined approach endospores and complimentary chemical methods to lakes of diverse environmental settings; and, iii) to assess experimentally the role of dormancy/germination on the establishment of specific communities of endospore-forming Firmicutes in response to environmental changes.

In this study we investigate the role of the bacterial sporobiota to act as a vector for ARG dispersal in aquatic ecosystems. The sporobiota was operationally defined as the resilient fraction of the bacterial community withstanding a harsh extraction treatment eliminating the easily lysed fraction of the total bacterial community. The sporobiota has been identified as a critical component of the human microbiome and therefore potentially a key element in the dissemination of ARG in human impacted environments. A region of Lake Geneva in which the accumulation of ARG in the sediments has been previously linked to the deposition of treated wastewater was selected to investigate the dissemination of tet (W) and sul 1 two genes conferring resistance to tetracycline and sulfonamide respectively. Analysis of the abundance of these ARG within the sporobiome (collection of genes of the sporobiota) and correlation with community composition and environmental parameters demonstrated that ARG can spread across the environment with the sporobiota being the dispersal vector. A highly abundant OTU affiliated with the genus Clostridium was identified as a potential specific vector for the dissemination of tet (W) due to a strong correlation with tet (W) frequency (ARG copy numbers/ng DNA). The high dispersal rate long term survival and potential reactivation of the sporobiota constitute a serious concern in terms of dissemination and persistence of ARG in the environment.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Low trans. involvement - High public outcome,9,40ies,e,3,Y,NA,NA,10,3,5,2,Y,NA,Y,Y,NA,NA,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,cocr,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,N,N,8,0,0,7,0,7,8,awar,NA,NA,awar,NA,beh,beh,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,7,NA,3,5,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,98,10,98

Jahrhundert die öffentliche Institution, um Kinder und Jugendliche durch Enkulturation, Qualifikation und Sozialisation in die Gesellschaft einzuführen; sie leistet einen wesentlichen Beitrag zum intergenerationalen Kultur-, Werte- und Wissenstransfer. Die Definition der in der Schule zu vermittelnden Wissensbestände und gesellschaftlichen Werte ist vielfältigen Einflüssen ausgesetzt und verändert sich im gesellschaftlichen Transformationsprozess ebenso wie die sie bestimmenden Akteure und deren Erwartungen und Wertvorstellungen. „Schulisches Wissen“ wird immer wieder von neuem gesellschaftlich konstruiert und legitimiert.

In a programmatic paper, Jäger and Rosenbach (2008) suggest a psychological explanation in terms of asymmetric priming. Asymmetric priming is a pattern of cognitive association in which one idea strongly evokes another, while that second idea does not evoke the first one with the same force. For instance, given the word lamp, the first association for many speakers is the word light. The reverse is not true: given the word light, many speakers offer the immediate associations sun, sky, or shadow before offering lamp. Asymmetric priming would elegantly explain the observation that many semantic changes in grammar are unidirectional: expressions of spatial relations evolve into markers of temporal relations (the English be going to future), expressions of temporal relations evolve into markers of causal relations (the English causal connector since), and expressions of possession evolve into markers of completion (the English have-perfect). Crucially, the inverse processes are unattested. The suggestion by Jäger and Rosenbach  has spawned a lively discussion in theoretical linguistics (Chang 2008, Eckardt 2008, Traugott 2008), but as yet, empirical engagements with the asymmetric priming hypothesis has been very limited. The proposed project has two objectives. First, it will make the asymmetric priming hypothesis more elaborate by including text frequency as a variable. Second, it will test the hypothesis in two studies that use different methodological approaches. The first study relies on behavioral, psycholinguistic data and investigates whether asymmetric priming relations obtain between grammatical forms and their lexical counterparts, i.e. pairs such as keep an eye on (lexical keep) and keep going (grammatical keep). On the asymmetric priming hypothesis, the former should prime the latter, but not vice versa. The second study uses observational, corpus-linguistic data to investigate asymmetric priming relations between different senses of the same word, as in strong fighter vs. strong argument. On the asymmetric priming hypothesis, less frequent senses of a word should prime more frequent senses, but not vice versa. The proposed project hopes to achieve the following three outcomes. First, the empirical results will elucidate whether or not asymmetric priming is a serious contender for an explanation of unidirectionality in grammatical semantic change. Second, the results will determine whether or not the text frequency of linguistic units has a role to play in asymmetric priming and in unidirectional semantic change. Third, and more generally, the project will establish theoretical and methodological connections between the areas of historical linguistics and cognitive psychology. While it is clear that psychological insights must inform accounts of how language changes, and while also data from language change should be of concern to psychologists, collaborations between these two fields remain relatively rare. It is hoped that the analysis of asymmetric priming as a mutual area of interest will encourage a rapprochement of the two fields.",619428,0000-0002-6347-5076,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results",Germany,01.01.2014,31.12.2016,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),The unidirectionality of semantic changes in grammaticalization: an experimental approach to the asymmetric priming hypothesis,"Hilpert Martin,  Correia Saavedra David",Published,2018,,10.1017/s1360674316000496,,English Language and Linguistics,,English Language and Linguistics,22,3,357,380,English Language and Linguistics,,Why is semantic change in grammaticalization typically unidirectional? It is a well established finding that in grammaticalizing constructions more concrete meanings tend to evolve into more schematic meanings. Jäger and Rosenbach (2008) appeal to the psychological phenomenon of asymmetric priming in order to explain this tendency. This paper aims to evaluate their proposal on the basis of experimental psycholinguistic evidence. Asymmetric priming is a pattern of cognitive association in which one idea strongly evokes another (i.e. paddle strongly evokes water) while that second idea does not evoke the first one with the same force (water only weakly evokes paddle). Asymmetric priming would elegantly explain why semantic change in grammaticalization tends to be unidirectional as in the case of English be going to which has evolved out of the lexical verb go. As yet empirical engagement with Jäger and Rosenbach’s hypothesis has been limited. We present experimental evidence from a maze task (Forster et al. 2009) in which we test whether asymmetric priming obtains between lexical forms (such as go) and their grammaticalized counterparts (be going to). On the asymmetric priming hypothesis the former should prime the latter but not vice versa. Contrary to the hypothesis we observe a negative priming effect: Speakers who have recently been exposed to a lexical element are significantly slower to process its grammaticalized variant. We interpret this observation as a horror aequi phenomenon (Rohdenburg and Mondorf 2003).,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Low motivation to improve human condition - high impact statement on emancipation/ capability/ understanding,3,40ies,d,4,Y,NA,NA,10,10,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,0,0,N,N,0,0,0,0,0,0,10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,und,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10,NA,10,7,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA

The major objective of this research is to investigate, as a paradigmatic segment of colonial Hong Kong's literary production, the body of sinophone coming-of-age narratives authored by refugees from mainland China who had relocated around the time of the establishment of the PRC in 1949 and frequently published their fiction in serial media installments.Since 1949 Hong Kong experienced an unprecedented influx of migrants, including many leading intellectuals from mainland China. This refugee crisis did not only bring spectacular growth to the city’s population, it also contributed to, and in fact shaped colonial Hong Kong's cultural life. Many among the immigrant intellectuals, locally identified as southbound literati, did not think of themselves as Hong Kong citizens, but waited to be able to move back home any time soon. Arriving in an unfamiliar and often hostile environment, they at first had to eke out a living by accepting underpaid odd jobs. Before long, however, they could resume their cultural activities, writing essays, fiction and poems while also launching publishing houses, newspapers, and journals. Being confronted with a largely unsettled population and an atmosphere laced with political and economic struggles in 1950s Hong Kong, the newly arrived intellectuals were the most articulate and sensitive witnesses of colonial arrogance, Cold War frictions, a lack of dedication to communal life, and a clutter of conflicting world views, norms and values. We argue that our selection of these authors' coming-of-age narratives exemplifies how these perplexingly different perspectives were negotiated in stories that self-consciously perpetuate, but also recode, a model of sinophone Bildungsroman writings originating in China's May Fourth modernism (1919-1937). The project thus engages with Hong Kong's colonial history by probing into a crucial aperture of its literary field. The proposed selection of texts conveys a uniquely insightful picture of the entanglements between global and local forces that prompted the formation of an alternative modernity arising from the margins of both the British empire and the Chinese nation. Our analysis of texts that draw as much from Chinese aesthetic conventions as from western literary modernity's paradigm figure of hope and progress, youth, will be based on close readings and supported by methods stemming from narrative theory, social history and discourse analysis. In particular, we are interested in the manner in which writers employed, and sometimes bent, existing generic formulae to represent their experience of abrupt downward mobility, feelings of homelessness and other disorientating spatio-temporal shifts. Exploring how the contradictions of the place and its subjects, for instance those between colonial disempowerment and capitalist success stories, Maoist revolution and Western restoration, survival struggles and aesthetic experiments, individual crisis and social fragmentation, were worked through and, if possible at all, reconciled, the project will contribute to the global history of a hitherto neglected, resilient cultural junction by showcasing one particular variant of a literary form that owes much to its European model, but ultimately may be better described by terms employed in other post-/colonial contexts, such as the novel of transformation.",507754,0000-0002-9685-3520,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication;Research Infrastructures;Exchange of personnel",Hongkong,01.05.2014,30.04.2017,Peer-reviewed,,IntroductionHong Kong Connections Across the Sinosphere,"Wu Helena,  Riemenschnitter Andrea",Published,2018,,10.1080/1369801x.2018.1538810,,Interventions,,Interventions,20,8,1073,1084,Interventions,,,153590,"Media relations: print media, online media",Hong Kong and its Many Different Shores,,2017,Low motivation to improve human condition - high impact statement on emancipation/ capability/ understanding,9,60ies,e,5,Y,NA,3,10,10,2,0,Y,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,0,0,0,N,N,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,awar,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,2,9,2,9,9,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,NA,NA,NA

In the present crisis of the Euro, which endangers European stability, we seek to contribute to a better understanding of how contemporary notions of Europe have been shaped. Since Britain finds itself, and has placed itself, on the margins of Europe in prominent discourses of othering, it will be highly instructive to study British projections of Europe over time and in various types of writing as well as in institutional discourses. The project was developed within the framework of the Centre of Competence Cultural Topographies at the University of Basel (www.kultop.unibas.ch). The Centre’s research focuses on ‘boundaries of Europe’, both geographical, and imagined or discursive. While important work at the Centre is concerned with the Eastern boundaries of Europe, the present project looks towards the Western margins, asking about the various ‘Europes’ that have been constructed in Britain, both in terms of participation as well as in processes of othering. The focus will be on cultural and particularly on literary discourses, which are multi-layered and at times self-reflexive, thus offering a representative basis for an analysis of complex cultural identities. Taking our cue from recent spatial theory, we aim to take a topological approach, investigating networks of people, texts and institutions (such as the British Council) which combine to shape the protean entity that is Europe. Even though we are concerned with, and about, the contemporary situation, we suggest that it can only be understood adequately by taking a longer view, beginning after the great chasm of World War I and taking into account the interwar period and the build-up to World War II, the War itself as well as the Cold War period, and post-reunification Europe. This time frame of roughly ninety years, or three generations, corresponds to Jan and Aleida Assmann’s notion of the contemporary, shaped by “communicative memory”, a “synchronic memory-space” (J. Assmann 2006: 8) defined by a specific relation between personal communication and representation through media as well as cultural artefacts (such as letters, photographs etc.). This time frame also makes sense from the point of view of British historiography concerned with Europe, which shifted its focus from a study of national histories to the study of alliances and international relations after World War I (Evans 2009), and in terms of technological developments in the media.Our project is divided into three PhD research projects. In selecting these, we focussed on literary and cultural discourses which transcend the boundaries of the nation state rather than on bilateral relations between Britain and other European nations. Placing the emphasis on topologies and networks will enable us to conduct an integrated analysis of texts (including fiction, travel writing and journalism), public discourses and biographies as well as institutional history and policies. Our cultural analysis will thus acknowledge a spatial dimension to the discourses of Europe without being tied to the ostensibly foundational realities of geographical ‘first space’ (Soja 1989). Three ‘cultural topographies’ have been selected which appear to be particularly resonant with regard to European discourses: the English Channel as a contact zone and space of exchange between Britain/England and France ('Stranded Dialogue. Identity, Memory and the English Channel'), the chiastic construction of East and West in Britain’s image of Europe (“Europe East and West: Literary Negotiations of a Blurry Borderline”), and the South of Europe as defined by the Mediterranean Sea (“South: Between the Pillars of Hercules and the Hellespont”). Links between these projects are manifold - they are historical, conceptual and topographical as well as topological, both in terms of geo-political constellations which structure the perception of Europe, and in terms of personal networks of relations, featuring such figures as Lawrence Durrell, poet, author of fiction and travel writer, who worked for the British Council and the Foreign Office in various capacities during World War II and the Cold War period and wrote extensively about Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean. One reason for the fact that British writers, or ‘men of letters’, often play a significant role in cultural and political institutions can be found in British club culture and the ‘Old Boys’ Network’ fostered by the public school and university systems (Wiener 1981). This produces a set of cultural and political players with a shared outlook and with personal connections to decision makers. Also, literary writing, including work often labelled as ‘middlebrow’, is an intrinsic part of the fabric of British life, and Britain has for a long time looked to its authors as significant voices within the public sphere, both for the dissemination of cultural values and the ‘projection of Britain’ abroad, and for accounts of the foreign at home. This holds true for the comparatively well-researched activities of travelling, working and writing in and about the British Empire, but also for Europe, where there is still a need for more sustained analysis. In terms of the relevance of our inquiry, we do not propose to conduct an empirical analysis of collective opinions, but we maintain that the imagery used and the views expressed in fiction and various forms of popular writing offer an adequate and representative reflection of the cultural imaginary of the nation, and of the important issues at stake.We hope to contribute to a more thorough understanding of Britain’s position towards a Europe where the ‘British stranger’ (Wall 2008) has taken residence, and we also feel that we are ideally placed to undertake such an investigation in Switzerland, a country that shares Britain’s marginality with regard to Europe and thus provides the instructive and in some respects privileged view of the stranger within.",548032,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Exchange of personnel",Great Britain and Northern Ireland,01.03.2014,31.08.2017,Peer-reviewed,Editors (peer-reviewed),The road to Brexit.

Analysing British discourses of Europe and the impact of British Euroscepticism the book argues that Britain’s exit from the European Union reflects a more general cultural rejection of continental Europe: Britain is in denial about the strength of its ties to Europe and needs to face Europe if it is to face the future. The volume brings together literary and cultural studies history and political science in an integrated analysis of views and practices that shape cultural memory and the cultural imaginary. Part One ‘Britain and Europe: Political entanglements’ traces the historical and political relationship between Britain and Europe and the place of Europe in recent British political debates while Part Two ‘British discourses of Europe in literature and film’ is devoted to representative case studies of films as well as popular Eurosceptic and historical fiction. Part Three ‘Negotiating borders in British travel writing and memoir’ engages with border mindedness and the English Channel as a contact zone also including a Gibraltarian point of view. Given the crucial importance of literature in British discourses of national identity the book calls for and embarks on a Euro British literary studies that highlights the nature and depth of the British European entanglement.,149175,"Media relations: print media, online media",Hellsichtige Literatur - Urs Hafner über Melanie Küngs Projekt,,2017,Low motivation to improve human condition - high impact statement on emancipation/ capability/ understanding,7,50ies,e,6,Y,NA,3,10,4,1,0,Y,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,cons,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,N,N,1,0,1,0,NA,1,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,beh,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,7,NA,8,10,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,NA,NA,NA

Because hydrogen production is an established, efficient process powered by renewable energy, large-scale CO2 hydrogenation can provide a green process for producing those alternative fuels/C1 feedstocks. The demand of methanol and formic acid in the near future is expected to drastically increase as methanol is a key C1 building block that can also be used in direct fuel cells and formic acid is considered as an efficient hydrogen carrier. While synthesis of methanol from syngas is a robust commercial process that can be readily adapted to CO2/H2 feeds, CO2 hydrogenation to formic acid is limited by thermodynamics and the facile decomposition of formic acid back to CO2 and H2. Furthermore, formic acid derivatives can only be produced using homogeneous catalysts, limiting process efficiency. The objective of this project is a direct conversion of CO2-derived methanol and formic acid to methyl formate intermediate in order to overcome thermodynamic constraints and to generate methanol and formic acid through its hydrolysis in a consecutive step. While methanol production and methyl formate hydrolysis are already well understood, an efficient overall process requires the development of robust heterogeneous CO2 hydrogenation catalysts selective for formic acid. Hence, the detailed understanding of the overall process, from the catalyst design to the process engineering, remains a formidable challenge. This project encompasses the development of efficient heterogeneous catalysts where two strategies will be evaluated: 1) the immobilization of homogeneous catalysts, which involves the understanding of the best ligand sets through a combined experimental and computational approaches and the subsequent development of the most promising immobilized catalysts, and 2) the tuning of selectivity of more classical heterogeneous catalysts for methanol synthesis towards methyl formate production, which involves both catalyst development and a detailed understanding of the surface chemistry of supported metal particles through in situ and computational studies. Additional critical aspects of this project are process engineering, microreactor and high-pressure technology under continuous operation (up to 1000 bar), which will bring advantages in catalyst screening, evaluating thermodynamic limits (the comprising reactions are known to be boosted at high pressure) and a simulation-based design of in situ cells for spectroscopic and visual inspection of phase behavior to identify possible phase separation during the reaction. It is thus not surprising that the project requires a synergistic approach, which combines the expertise across the scale of catalyst design and evaluation: from molecular chemistry and immobilization of homogeneous catalysts (group of Prof. Copéret), surface chemistry and classical heterogeneous catalysis including spectroscopy (group of Dr. A. Urakawa), computational chemistry (group of Prof. J. VandeVondele) and process engineering (Prof. P. Rudolf von Rohr).",12010,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Low motivation to improve human condition - high impact statement on emancipation/ capability/ understanding,10,60ies,e,3,Y,NA,NA,6,8,0,0,NA,NA,Y,NA,NA,NA,2,0,1,1,1,1,0,cocr,NA,cons,contr,cons,cons,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,0,1,1,N,N,1,5,0,0,5,7,10,NA,awar,NA,NA,awar,und,und,NA,4,Y,NA,NA,NA,7,3,1,1,5,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,5,5,1

Many composers who traditionally have been the foremost interpreters of their own music are now at old age or no longer alive. The same can be said of other important witnesses to history such as instrumentalists, conductors, technicians, studio assistants and musicians concerned with performance and sound projection. Younger generations of musicians and researchers are now becoming involved with this repertoire. For any of them, but particularly for performers, the question of how to perform a piece taking into account its specific artistic, historic and technical genesis becomes critical, considering that the technical means available nowadays are completely different from historical conditions. The disappearance of old technologies and the availability of new ones present challenges while opening up new possibilities. Different attitudes and experiences of today’s audiences must be taken into account as well. As in (instrumental) performance practice of older music, those questions lead into an area marked by the tension between historical performance practice and modern reception. The preservation of knowledge about the genesis of electroacoustic works, the original performance conditions and the development of a performance tradition is an essential prerequisite for developing an adequately informed interpretation practice.In order to gather the evidence necessary for developing adequate interpretation criteria for specific works, thorough philological investigations of different sources like sketches, scores, diagrams, photographs, films, letters and audio documents must be undertaken.  The study of audio material like base recordings, working materials reflecting different compositional stages, preliminary mixes, different versions and historical performances must be done in hearing in analogy to the composition process in the studio. Hypotheses on issues like versions, number of channels, spatial configuration of sound sources and the audience’s position, channel distribution, kind and properties of technical means, dynamics and spatialization of projected audio, amplification of instruments, etc. must then be validated in a dialogue with experienced performers and historical witnesses under spatial and technical conditions corresponding to real performances. The possibility to experiment with different sound projection devices and configurations according to artistic intentions and spatial conditions is a prerequisite.Accordingly, the project aims to establish a research methodology for performance practice of electroacoustic music where musicologists and performers enter into a practice-based dialogue. Such a dialogue between theory and practice serves a double purpose: to deliver a model for research methodology and to yield concrete results with respect to compositions that can be considered exemplary study subjects in terms of the problems they present to performers.Providing methods of study and practice-validated evidence that allow performers to formulate their own interpretation criteria, the overarching objective of the project is thus to contribute to the realization of artistically adequate performances of electroacoustic works.The collaboration with the Paul Sacher Stiftung and the continuing collaboration with a select group of universities, archives, publishers, musicologists and performers constitutes a unique network allowing to integrate precious knowledge and experience and provides the basis for a broad impact.",547750,,Research Infrastructures,Italy,01.09.2014,31.08.2016,Peer-reviewed,Proceedings (peer-reviewed),Spatial concepts and performance practice.

Together structural and dynamic information will provide unique insights into the function of proteins as principal building blocks of our biology.We suggest studying the structural dynamics of several members from the seven transmembrane helix (7TM) class of proteins. 7TM proteins are found in organisms ranging from archaea to humans and are adapted to fulfill a wide range of biological functions. Located in the cellular membrane, most 7TM proteins act as pumps or channels to allow passage of ions, or as transducers of biological signals. The latter has important implications for pharmacology, as the largest family of 7TM proteins, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), includes about 30% of all human drug targets. We will initially focus on retinal binding 7TM proteins, as they can be activated with a flash of laser light. As the classical model to study the family of 7TM proteins, bacteriorhodopsin (bR) is ideal to establish the technology. As example of a light-gated ion channel we will probe the structural dynamics of channelrhodopsin. The study of this retinal binding 7TM protein has important optogenetic applications in probing of neural circuits with millisecond precision. In a next step we will extent our studies to the visual photoreceptor rhodopsin as member of the GPCR class of 7TM proteins. Our previous studies have shown how perturbation of rhodopsin activation leads to the development of severe retinopathy. Understanding the dynamics of this process will provide crucial information on the development of hereditary blindness. Finally, we will study the human chemokine receptor CCR7, as an example for a non-retinal binding 7TM protein. Activation of CCR7 regulates the migration of memory T cells and stimulates dendritic cell maturation in inflammatory responses. We will investigate these proteins using time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography (TR-SFX). We have several reasons to prefer serial crystallography over other methods to study protein intermediates like freeze-trapping or Laue crystallography. The highly brilliant pulses of an X-FEL allow collecting high-resolution data from nano- to micrometer sized crystals that can be homogenously activated. X-FELs allow the investigation of dynamics from the femto- to millisecond range and are less dependent on strongly diffracting crystals with low mosaic spreads. Furthermore, the use of lipidic cubic phases (LCP) for crystal growth and delivery has significantly reduced the amount of protein needed for serial crystallographic experiments. Importantly, data collection using highly brilliant femtosecond laser pulses allows to outrun radiation damage and determine membrane protein structures at previously unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. The Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) provides an ideal research environment for this project with access to well-equipped laboratory space, robotic crystallization facilities and the Swiss Light Source (SLS) synchrotron. The proposed project will further benefit from the developing X-FEL community around the Swiss Free Electron Laser (SwissFEL) currently under construction at the PSI.

For these reasons, many computer vision based gaze estimation have been proposed. Some achieve high accuracy but require expensive or specialized hardware. A solution based on consumer hardware is needed and to minimize intrusion and accommodate user's movement, remote cameras with wide enough field of view are preferred but lead to the challenge of low resolution imaging. From a methodological viewpoint, two main approaches exist. Geometric ones based on explicit eye geometry models can be very accurate but rely on high resolution images to fit and track the local features (glints, pupil center...) used to estimate the geometric parameters. On the other side, appearance based methods, which learn a direct mapping between the eye image and gaze parameters avoid feature tracking, but often need test data close to the training set in terms of user, gaze space, and illumination conditions.Leveraging on our previous work, we propose the current G3E project to investigate a novel head-pose independent gaze estimation method that takes advantage of the appearance and geometric methods. It relies on an appearance based probabilistic generative process that model the generation of head-pose independent eye images recovered thanks to the use of consumer RGB-D cameras. By using an explicit geometric gaze model, we will handle head pose and gaze direction in a unified framework, allowing 3D space reasoning and extrapolating to gaze directions not seen in the training data. On the other hand, by modeling the generation of semantic regions (eyelids, cornea, sclera), we will decouple the gazing process and user geometry from the ambient conditions (color appearance), while avoiding the critical local feature (cornea/iris) fitting and tracking problems of standard geometric methods.The project will study different modeling options to address the problem (details of geometric model, eyes coupling, image stabilization), and in particular several inference schemes to achieve the difficult learning from low resolution images. In a second thread, we will investigate the bayesian properties of the model to address the unsupervised learning and adaptation to user (eye geometry), session, and interpretation, by leveraging on relevant priors (eye color palettes, multimodal communication patterns like eye-contact or gaze-aversion and human attitudes in dynamic human-human interaction settings).The project will thus address a fundamental component towards human-human or human-computer communication perception, and will make an important contribution in the fields of social signal processing, which aims at the development of computational models for machine understanding of communicative and social behavior, or in HRI and HCI like for multimodal information desk design.",524289,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication;Research Infrastructures",Sweden,01.04.2014,31.01.2015,Peer-reviewed,Proceedings (peer-reviewed),Tracking and Automatic Gaze Coding from RGB- D Cameras,Kenneth Funes Mora and Jean-Marc Odobez,Published,2014,,,http://publications.idiap.ch/downloads/papers/2014/FunesMora_CVPRW_2014.pdf,CVPR Workshop: When vision meets cognition,",",CVPR Workshop: When vision meets cognition,,,,,CVPR Workshop: When vision meets cognition,"Columbus, OH",Gaze is recognized as one of the most important cues for the analysis of the cognitive behaviors of a person such as the attention displayed towards objects or people their interactions functionality and causality patterns.

Some arrhythmias are responsible for a highly increased risk of ischemic strokes leading to a higher morbidity and mortality. Therefore, early detection and prevention of adverse arrhythmia-related events are crucial. In case where an interventional treatment of arrhythmias is indicated, the planning of the intervention strongly relies on the type of arrhythmia diagnosed based on standard 12-channel body surface electrocardiograms (ECGs). The diagnostic accuracy of this standard approach is however limited. Our approach is to complement these 12-channel surface ECGs by ECGs captured additionally from inside of the esophagus. The signal quality of these esophageal ECGs is superior to the surface ECGs due to the proxim­ity of the measuring electrodes to the origin of the electrical signals from the heart’s muscle, the myocardium; addition­ally, we devise specially constructed catheters that allow a 3-dimensional description oft the heart depolarization process. We expect that our new approach outperforms the diagnostic accuracy of the 12-channel ECGs and renders it­self suitable to bedside decision making by providing more detailed information on arrhythmias.The overall aim of the research project is to find technically realizable solutions that achieve the above stated objec­tives, and to validate the feasibility of the approach and to characterize its performance quality. In detail we research as follows: First, to exhaust the full potential of esophageal ECG measurements, we investigate on esophageal catheters with complex electrode configurations and algorithms to localize the spatial origin and the evolution of electrical depolarization in the heart. Second, with the resulting catheters we execute clinical trials that simultaneously capture esophageal ECG signals together with measurements of the exact depolarization inside of the heart using heart catheters during electrophysiology (EP) studies. Third, we use these data - the intracardiac measurements and the corresponding ECG signal from the esophagus - to search for an appropriate model for the 3D signal mapping from heart to esophagus as basis to research for an inverse mapping algorithm (esophageal ECG signals to heart depolarization propagation). Fourth, we validate the resulting algorithm with additional clinical electrophysiology studies, thereby we perform dedicated pacing and induction maneuvers to provoke various focal trigger activities in the heart. Healthcare profession­als compare sensitivity and specificity of a correct arrhythmia identification using our approach and relate it to the diag­nostic accuracy of standard 12-channel ECGs. Fifth, we research on hardware implementation architectures and parti­tioning of the devised signal processing algorithms for either low-power or high-speed objectives.The defined research procedure reveals the tight link and strong interdependency of the five steps: the engineering side develops catheters, corresponding measurement techniques, and signal processing algorithms; the medical side uses these tools in their clinical work to produce measurement data, to validate the computational results, and to gain deeper insights for improving diagnosis and bedside decision making based on more detailed information on arrhythmias.",561496,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Research Infrastructures;Industry/business/other use-inspired collaboration",Switzerland,01.05.2016,31.12.2019,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,166030,"Media relations: print media, online media",Im Netzwerk zu neuen Medtech Produkten,https://www.bfh.ch/de/aktuell/news/im-netzwerk-zu-neuen-medtech-produkten/,2019,"High motivation to imp. human condition + changed behaviour (public, policy, civil society orgs)",8,60ies,e,3,Y,NA,NA,10,10,9,2,NA,NA,NA,Y,Y,NA,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,colla,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,colla,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,N,N,7,4,2,10,0,0,9,und,und,NA,beh,NA,NA,awar,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,8,8,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,7,7,98

Untreated pregnancy-related depression increases the risk of pretermbirth, low birth weight of the infant, smoking and substance use, shortening ofbreast-feeding and can have significant negative effect on the emotional and cognitivedevelopment of the infants. The pathophysiology of PND is currently unknown andpredictors of perinatal depressive symptoms remain poorly understood. Sleep ismarkedly disturbed during pregnancy and the postpartum period with up to 75% ofpregnant women experiencing some form of sleep disruption during pregnancy such aspoor sleep quality or sleep continuity and/or specific sleep disorders such as therestless legs syndrome and sleep disordered breathing. Given that in the generalpopulation, insomnia has been established as a risk factor for the development ofdepression, impaired sleep during the perinatal period could be a critical risk factor forthe development of PND and structured assessment of sleep and sleep disorders couldhelp identify women at risk for developing depression. Treatment of PND andpregnancy-associated sleep disorders poses a complex problem during the perinatalperiod due to concerns about adverse effects of treatments on the fetus and later theinfant during the breast-feeding period. Psychotherapeutic interventions have beenshown to be effective in PND but due to limited availability and logistic issues, such aschildcare arrangements, women with PND might be less likely to participate. Brightlight treatment is a low cost, home-based treatment with established efficacy for othertypes of depression. Its efficacy for PND has so far been evaluated in only a very limitednumber of studies with mixed results that partly may have been due to the universallysmall sample sizes included. Nevertheless, bright light treatment has been shown topositively affect depression, sleep disorders, circadian synchronization and possiblyserotonergic mechanisms implicated in depression, which makes its systematicevaluation for the treatment of PND is especially promising. In summary, PND is aserious concern during the perinatal period and there is a currently an unmet need forthe early and reliable identification of females at risk for PND as well as safe treatmentoptions. These concerns will be directly addressed in the proposed project.Objectives: 1) to systematically explore and characterise risk factors for perinataldepression by prospectively assessing sleep markers, sleep disorders, inflammatorymarkers and other potential markers during the perinatal period (work package (WP)1), 2) to investigated the effectiveness of light therapy in treating perinatal depression(WP2), and 3) to test whether a short term trial of light therapy during pregnancy canprevent postnatal depression (WP3).Experimental design/Methods: WP1: prospective cohort study following 500 pregnantwomen during pregnancy up to 12 months after delivery. Genetic, inflammatory, andsleep markers will be assessed during pregnancy. Sleep, circadian rhythm, and moodwill be assessed every three months during pregnancy and postpartum with the aim toidentify early predictive markers of perinatal depression. WP2: Minor and majordepression will be assessing during pregnancy and postpartum and women withdepressive symptoms will be randomised (1:1) to 6 week treatment with bright light orplacebo dim light to explore effectiveness of bright light therapy during for perinataldepression. WP3: During pregnancy (Month 6), a random sample of subjects will beassigned to 6 weeks bright light therapy to explore whether this treatment can preventthe onset of postpartum depression.Expected Value of the proposed Project: Perinatal depression is one of the mostcommon complications of child bearing. It can have devastating consequences both forthe women and their children and family. This project will improve our understandingof the precursors and risk factors for perinatal depression that can aid in the earlyidentification of women at risk for perinatal depression. Further, results of the plannedrandomised clinical trial of bright light for perinatal depression will establish whetherthis easy and safe, at-home treatment that has been documented to be effective intreating depression outside pregnancy, can be an viable treatment options during theperinatal period. Finally, given its serious, long-term consequences it would bepreferable to prevent postpartum depression rather than treat it once it is establishedand we will explore whether light therapy after delivery can prevent the onset ofpostpartum depression. In summary, the proposed project is expected to significantlycontribute to improved care and treatment of women during and after pregnancy andultimately to the long-term well being of mothers, children and family.",600548,0000-0002-1849-7196,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Research Infrastructures",Switzerland,01.11.2015,31.10.2019,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),Management Strategies for Restless Legs Syndrome/Willis-Ekbom Disease During Pregnancy,"Garbazza Corrado,  Manconi Mauro",Published,2018,,10.1016/j.jsmc.2018.05.001,,Sleep Medicine Clinics,,Sleep Medicine Clinics,13,3,335,348,Sleep Medicine Clinics,,Restless legs syndrome/Willis Ekbom disease is a common disorder during pregnancy that may significantly impact on the health of affected women leading to negative consequences in the short and long term.

Integrating theoretical perspectives from Clinical/Social, Motivation, Geronto- and Developmental Psychology, our research project examines predictors of close relationship functioning, the development of close relationships and the likelihood for separation and marital dissolution as well as the impact of close relationships on the well-being of children within a prospective longitudinal study. Three age cohorts of couples (20-35 years, 40-55 y., and 65-80 y.) with a total of 360 couples (120 couples per cohort) and their children are investigated by means of (a) self-report, (b) behavioral observation, and (c) psycho-physiological measures. The present proposal aims at a prolongation of our Sinergia project 'Impact of stress on relationship development of couples and children: A longitudinal approach on dyadic development across the lifespan' (CRSI11_133004). In the current first period of funding we have successfully completed the first wave of data collection with a total of 720 participants and have presented preliminary results at numerous conventions. Furthermore, we have already surveyed more than half of our participants for a second time (wave 2). As the core goal of our project is to track developmental trajectories within couples over at least four years we intend to accomplish three more waves each separated by one year. Data collection includes predictors on the individual level (cognitive and emotional variables: neuroticism, implicit and explicit motives, motive specific and motive oriented activities, need satisfaction, stress, coping), the dyadic level  (communication behaviour, dyadic coping, commitment, goals, attachment, sexuality, etc.) as well as child level (well-being of children perceived by parents as well as children themselves). The study integrates insights from diverse theoretical perspectives: a) Clinical/Social Psychological research on different facets of stress (extradyadic versus intradyadic stress, macro versus micro-stress, acute versus chronic stress) and coping (individual and dyadic coping); b) Motivation psychological research on cognitive and affective processes related to implicit and explicit motives and approach/avoidance goals with its implications for self-regulation; c) Gerontopsychological research focusing on relationships and relationship development in older couples; and d) Developmental Psychological research with the focus on protective and risk factors in families. Five broader theoretical and practical issues are addressed: First, how do individual, dyadic, and environmental factors combine to development and deterioration in the couple relationship? Second, what are the similarities and differences in the ways couples at three distinct phases in the family life cycle change and develop within behavioural, cognitive, emotional and motivational domains? Third, what are the associations between changes in couple relationships and changes in child well-being (relevant for the two younger cohorts)?

Uncertainty itself may have varying degrees of depth. To illustrate, the effects of uncertainty around an earning announcement for a blue chip are likely different from those regarding an uncertainty event such as September-11. How do markets respond to such large events? Answering this question necessitates designing and elaborating on a set of assumptions about how markets operate in terms of their trading structure, the agents' access to information, and the asset classes that are the most likely exposed to uncertainty episodes. Most of the work in the literature addresses these issues while maintaining the assumption that capital markets operate under conditions of symmetric information. My research plans build on previous work of mine in which, instead, I deal with markets with asymmetric information while at the same time relaxing what is arguably one of our most standard assumptions: that uncertainty can be quantified probabilistically. My work, then, is an attempt at merging two fields: one, relating to the study of markets with asymmetric information and another, relating to the study of markets in which agents face 'Knightian uncertainty,' that is, the situation in which we would not be even able to determine what the likelihood of events is, just as in the case of September-11. But my work on uncertainty also regards themes that have a quite applied nature: how can financial economists help investors design new instruments to cope with capital market volatility?Both theory and applied work have led me to a consistent publication record in these domains and to establish a coherent research plan for the next three years. My applied work also led to the adoption of new standards for measuring and trading volatility on an institutional basis in industry-wide applications, as I shall explain in more detail below. In my research agenda in the theory space, I aim to examine in great detail how markets respond to large uncertainty events, and also to consolidate my work on asymmetric information and heterogeneous agents in markets plagued with Knightian uncertainty. In my research agenda in the applied space, I aim to develop models that help mitigate investors' losses arising from capital market volatility, relying on my previous work on 'tradable uncertainty' that has been adopted in industry-wide applications.",602671,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",Great Britain and Northern Ireland,01.09.2017,31.10.2019,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"High motivation to imp. human condition + changed behaviour (public, policy, civil society orgs)",7,50ies,e,2,Y,NA,NA,10,10,10,2,NA,Y,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,colla,NA,NA,colla,NA,NA,NA,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,N,N,10,10,0,0,0,10,10,und,beh,NA,NA,NA,beh,beh,NA,7,NA,NA,Y,NA,10,0,0,0,10,10,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,10,0,0

Switzerland has followed other countries: since 2012 Swiss acute-care hospitals have been required to use diagnosis related groups (SwissDRG) as reimbursement system for inpatient care, implemented as part of a wider health care reform.In our previous study we analyzed the legal framework governing SwissDRG and interviewed hospital managers to explore how hospitals react to the DRG-based reimbursement system. We found that the changing economic incentives in inpatient care induce a shift in the service supply of hospitals. Especially services with a high proportion of nursing care (“Pflege”) are less attractive for hospitals. In this previous research we identified an important research gap concerning inpatient-outpatient transitions. While cost shifts are taking place, no data exist about legal aspects and consequences of the overlapping new reimbursement regulations for inpatient and outpatient transitory care measures, including nursing care.This projects follows an interdiciplinary approach and has three major objectives:(1) Advance knowledge on the extent in which the legal frameworks concerning the two reformed financing systems interact and whether the present regulations provide sufficiently clear guidance (part 1).(2) Obtain new data on stakeholder views concerning the implementation of the new legal frameworks in five different cantons (part 2a).

In the most advanced heart failure, transplantation of a donor heart remains the only possibility for improving the quality of life and survival. Unfortunately, this life-saving therapy is available to only a fraction of those who need it because of the constant shortage of available donors.Currently donation after declaration of circlatory death (DCDD) represent an untapped source of hearts that could significantly increase the availability of donor organs. However, DCDD hearts inevitably undergo a period of warm ischemia (interruption of blood flow) prior to procurement. Paradoxically, although reperfusion (return of blood flow) is required to salvage tissue, it induces processes that further damage the heart. Given that cardiac tolerance to warm ischemia is very short, especially if donation consent must be attained, this period is likely to limit the number of acceptable donors. Therefore, clinically acceptable means to reduce ischemic injury or prolong ischemic tolerance, as well would be of great benefit in facilitating the use of DCDD organs.Importantly, in the context of DCDD, interventions to preserve donor organs are limited for ethical reasons. Thus, to be clinically applicable in this setting, techniques to reduce cardiac ischemic injury must be restricted to those which can be initiated after the onset of ischemia. It is for these reasons that we have chosen to focus our efforts on protection against ischemic injury through interventions applied upon reperfusion. Given that modulation of cardiac energy metabolism at reperfusion has an enormous potential to influence hemodynamic recovery after a period of ischemia, we have chosen to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in mechanical postconditioning-induced cardioprotection. Our overall aim is to identify clinically relevant approaches to improve hemodynamic outcomes in cardiac grafts obtained with DCDD, ultimately to improve donor heart supply.

However DCD hearts undergo potentially deleterious warm ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). As endothelial damage is a key factor in cardiac I/R injury we aimed to investigate the tolerance of cardiac and endothelial function after various durations of warm ischemia to improve the timing and choice of cardioprotective therapies.  METHODS:   Isolated working rat hearts were perfused for 20 minutes aerobically then underwent various periods of warm global ischemia and either 30 or 60 minutes of reperfusion.  RESULTS:   Compared with non ischemic hearts recovery of left ventricular work (heart rate developed pressure product) was significantly reduced at 60 minutes of reperfusion with ≥27 minutes of ischemia (p <0.05 for all) but was unchanged after 21 or 24 minutes of ischemia. Markers of cell death and edema significantly increased with ≥27 minute ischemia compared with non ischemic hearts (p <0.05 for all). Endothelial dependent vasodilation was significantly impaired compared with non ischemic hearts with ≥24 minutes of ischemia whereas endothelial independent vasodilation was impaired with ≥27 minutes of ischemia (p <0.05 for all). Furthermore with ≥24 minutes of ischemia superoxide production by nitric oxide synthase and peroxynitrite levels were significantly increased compared with non ischemic hearts suggesting endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) uncoupling (p <0.05 for both).  CONCLUSIONS:   The first signs of endothelial dysfunction after cardiac ischemia occur with less ischemia than cardiac functional alterations and may result from increased eNOS uncoupling. Strategies aimed at improving eNOS coupling may thus help to optimize both endothelial and myocardial recovery ultimately facilitating DCD heart transplantation.,149730,Other activities,50.

With this calibration the DGT technique will be available for a wide range of future Pu studies.•  The determination of the labile fraction of plutonium in freshwaters, one with a low content of DOM, one with a high content of DOM.•  A better understanding of the accumulation of plutonium in the intra-cellular fraction of mosses.•  The integration of all measured parameters into a suitable speciation model (e.g. WHAM model, (Tipping, 1994), which will allow to improve the understanding of 239Pu uptake and toxicity in the biosphere. The significance of this study is beyond the freshwaters of the karst of the Jura Mountains, which will serve as a model of many other freshwaters.

Assessing the bioavailability of radionuclides predicts the toxic effects to aquatic biota. The technique of diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) is largely exploited for bioavailability measurements of trace metals in waters. However it has not been applied for plutonium speciation measurements yet. This study investigates the use of DGT technique for plutonium bioavailability measurements in chemically different environments. We used a diffusion cell to determine the diffusion coefficients (D) of plutonium in polyacrylamide (PAM) gel and found D in the range of 2.06 – 2.29 × 10 6 cm2 s 1.  It ranged between 1.10 and 2.03 ×10 6 cm2 s 1 in the presence of fulvic acid and in natural waters with low DOM.  In the presence of 20 ppm of humic acid of an organic rich soil plutonium diffusion was hindered by a factor of 5 with a diffusion coefficient of 0.50 × 10 6 cm2 s 1. We also tested commercially available DGT devices with Chelex resin for plutonium bioavailability measurements in laboratory conditions and the diffusion coefficients agreed with those from the diffusion cell experiments. These findings show that the DGT methodology can be used to investigate the bioaccumulation of the labile plutonium fraction in aquatic biota. ,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,High SI familiarity (and/or high overall SI stats),6,50ies,e,6,Y,NA,8,8,7,7,2,NA,NA,Y,NA,Y,NA,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,cocr,NA,NA,contr,NA,NA,NA,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,N,Y,2,5,0,0,5,7,9,NA,awar,NA,NA,und,beh,beh,NA,7,NA,NA,NA,methodology,6,2,6,8,10,10,1,NA,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,1

Childhood eating habits establish life long eating habits and overweight and obese children are more likely to retain their condition and associated consequences through adulthood. A variety of social, environmental and interpersonal factors have been examined as potential determinants of eating behaviors. However, there is little information regarding the characteristics and social determinants of dietary intake among Swiss children. The research uses existing data to examine eating behaviors and nutrition patterns of children in Ticino Switzerland and focuses on the influence of social settings on eating habits. It offers a detailed examination of children’s eating behaviors and their social setting that contributes to a sharper focus on the underlying mechanisms of influence. The study will be the first to examine the eating habits of children ages 6-12 in Ticino. Further, it is the only study to date to measure changes to eating behaviors and social setting influence post a family based e-health intervention. The child-parent data provide information about children’s food consumption habits as well as demographic and social cognitive data for both parents and children. The length of time covered by the children’s food and activity diaries is another strength as past research typically relies on 2 or 3 days of eating, whereas the behavioral data for this study spans 7 consecutive days. Further, most studies of eating behaviors examine weight outcomes, (such as BMI or in fewer examples, physical measures of adiposity) and use samples of overweight and obese children. This study focuses on food consumption choices and compliance with dietary recommendations using a large, representative sample with all weight and income categories included. Thus, it also allows for the examination of different eating habits by healthy weight children, as well as overweight, obese and underweight children.The research has scientific and practical implications for the development of policy and sustainable strategies for children’s eating habits in Switzerland and other countries. We will describe preadolescent eating behaviors, identifying specific social settings and their association with eating behaviors and SSN guidelines. The detailed description of children’s eating habits will demonstrate the type of food that children consume in different social settings.

The aim of this study was to describe children's dietary behaviors in terms of adherence to the Swiss Society for Nutrition (SSN) dietary guidelines and possible determinants.   Methods: Cross sectional study conducted in September 2010 with 568 children aged 6 12 years old living in Ticino Switzerland. Food intake was collected using 7 day food logs. Adherence with the dietary guidelines from the SSN was assessed according to age group.   Results: With the exception of fish and cereals/potatoes intake (adherence rates of 68.5 and 47.9 respectively) adherence to SSN guidelines was low: 26.9 for meat; 22.7 for eggs;; 10.4 for fruit; 9.5 for sweets snacks  soft drinks; 3.5 for milk  dairy and 0 for vegetables. Multivariate analysis showed no consistent association between the child or their parent's socio demographic characteristics and adherence to SSN guidelines. Girls had a higher likelihood of adhering with fruit and meat guidelines: multivariate adjusted odds ratio (95 confidence interval) 1.98 (1.10 3.56) and 1.80 (1.08 2.99) respectively. Children aged 10 to 12 had a lower likelihood of adhering with cereals and potatoes 0.48 (0.29 0.78) and a higher likelihood of adhering with eggs guideline 1.78 (1.00 3.15).  Conclusion: Dietary intake of Ticinese children show poor adherence with SSN guidelines. Given the lack of specific socio demographic factors associated with adherence population wide interventions to improve dietary intake are necessary.  ,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,High SI familiarity (and/or high overall SI stats),9,50ies,e,9,Y,NA,7,10,10,10,2,Y,NA,NA,Y,NA,NA,2,0,1,2,2,2,2,cocr,NA,contr,cocr,cocr,contr,cons,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,Y,Y,8,0,5,5,5,8,10,und,NA,beh,und,und,beh,other,how to measure eating behavior in children in a valid way,7,NA,Y,NA,NA,9,4,10,8,10,10,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,10,10,10

Surface Electromyography (sEMG) currently gives some control capabilities but these are limited, often not natural and usually require long training times. The application of modern machine learning techniques to analyse sEMG activity related to natural movements seems promising but it is far from practice due to two main aspects. First, the effects of the amputation on the nervous system of the subjects are not fully clear; second, there is a strong lack of accuracy in the movement classication accuracy and a few wrong movements can have important negative effects. In recent work, we started to improve this situation through the establishment of a benchmark database of sEMG data for hand movements (htttp://ninapro.hevs.ch/) , which was welcomed with enthusiasm by the scientic community. Other recent scientic papers show that the combination of visual data and electromyography can strongly extend the capabilities of dexterous prostheses.With MEGANE PRO, we aim to bring the research in this field to its next step, i.e. to better understand the neurologic and neurocognitive effects of amputation on the persons and to strongly improve robotic prosthesis control possibilities by hand amputated subjects. Thus, this project could improve the state of the art in hand prosthetics and also improve the clinical outcome of the patients (e.g., by respecting the individual phantom limb phenomenology). We aim to pursue this objective along four collaborating approaches that are the sub-projects.Subproject 1: data acquisition, curation and sharing (Information Systems Institute, HES-SO, Sierre) - The subproject consists of three main parts in which all teams collaborate. During the first part, we create the acquisition setup and protocol that is based on the fusion between sEMG and gaze protocols. During the second,  we recruit hand amputated subjects mainly in Switzerland (and potentially abroad) and we perform data acquistions. During the third, we perform data curation and release the data on the Ninapro websiteSubproject 2: neuro-cognitive analyses (University Hospital, Zurich) - Subproject 2 will improve present-day understanding of hand-grasp-associated predictive eye movements in natural settings (almost the entire literature with normally-limbed subjects has focused on handling artificial laboratory situations). The subproject consists of three main parts. First, we investigate eye movements during simple grasps and manipulations of objects in natural situations. Second, we study how far eye movements during grasping are predictive of situational demands (e.g. object characteristics or task goals). Third, we explore individual differences in participants  gaze behavior during imagined object manipulations.Subproject 3: unimodal adaptive control of prosthetic hands (IDIAP Research Center, Martigny) - This subproject focuses on the development of adaptive learning algorithms capable to exploit prior knowledge gathered by the user as well as from intact subjects. IDIAP and UNIROMA1 will mainly collaborate in it using data acquired by the HES-SO. Subproject 4: multi-modal adaptive control of prosthetic hands (La Sapienza University, Rome, UNIROMA1, Italy) - The overall goal of this subproject is to develop a coherent framework of learning algorithms able to significantly advance the state of the art in sEMG controlled prostheses in terms of control, stability and dexterity. The prosthesis controllers will be enriched by autonomous decision making that operate through the analysis of multimodal data.

In the preceding study (SNF-100013_132210/1) that had its roots in the same research paradigm, this question was investigated among pupils in grade seven. In the current study, a follow-up of these individuals in the eighth and ninth grades is conducted. The focus of this research is to assess the longitudinal effects of class composition and to determine which conditions make youngsters most susceptible to the influence of their peers. Further, detailed information on the development of aggression, delinquency, and school-related problem behaviours in Swiss lower secondary schools will be provided.Background:Dissocial behaviours, such as aggression and delinquency, can pose several challenges for teachers, classmates, and the concerned students themselves. Hence, it is important to establish the causes and underlying mechanisms leading to such behaviour. While there is a consensus that dissocial behaviour has multiple causes, less is known about the role that schools play in this process. In a school environment, teachers can act as important agents of socialization; however, the students at school might exert positive or negative influences on each other as well (e.g. through behaviour modelling or social reinforcement). Therefore, it could be expected that the classroom composition will affect students’ individual behavioural development. Specifically, attending classes with a high amount of problem behaviours might result in the development of more dissocial behaviours over time than might be found when attending prosocial classes. In addition, specific subgroups of students in a given class (such as popular students, deviant students, or personal friends) might exert a special influence on their classmates. When examining these questions, it will also be possible to state which students are most susceptible to peer influence. Besides of shedding light on these psychological processes that underlie dissocial behaviour, this research will also aim to provide reliable information on the incidence of aggression, delinquency, and school-related problem behaviour in the Swiss lower secondary school system. Here, a special emphasis will be placed on the investigation of the rates of dissocial behaviour across grades seven, eight, and nine, as well as among different academic tracks (specifically, the high, middle, low, and special educational tracks). Methods: In the first FRI-PEERS research project (SNF-100013_132210/1), it was examined whether the class composition had an influence on dissocial behaviour among seventh grade students, using a short-term longitudinal design with four measurement points throughout the school year. The study was conducted in the Swiss canton of Fribourg, and all seventh grade students from the German speaking part of that region took part (n=825). In this follow-up study, we expand upon that research by re-examining the same subjects in both eighth and ninth grade. This will allow us to perform detailed analyses of the longitudinal development of students’ problem behaviours. Further, the potential long-term effects of class composition and its moderators on students’ behaviours can be examined.Data collection will involve anonymous reports of students’ own and classmates’ behaviours, social status, and networks. Additional information on several other characteristics of the sample will be gathered (e.g. socioeconomic status, antisocial attitudes, levels of self-worth, quality of life). Data will be analysed using multilevel modelling. Significance: The FRI-PEERS research project offers a deeper understanding of the factors that contribute to the development of dissocial behaviour and provides several practical implications. First, findings pertaining to the advantages and disadvantages of specific class compositions in terms of student behaviour are relevant for decisions on a local school level. Second, the results contribute to the knowledge about the effectiveness of different academic tracking systems, which can potentially vary in terms of the level of aggregation of youngsters exhibiting problem behaviours. Further, these questions relate to the current discussions on the pros and cons surrounding the inclusion of special needs students with behavioural problems in regular schools. Last but not least, the study provides reliable data on the social development of students in lower secondary schools in a Swiss canton, indicating potential differences between the grades and academic tracks. This information is important for the prospective planning of preventive actions in Switzerland.

In Switzerland as in most European countries many single family houses are still being built in the farthest peripheries of urban agglomerations. Characterized by low density and spatial specialization urban sprawl is highly dependent on fossil fuels. Furthermore due to recent society evolutions dwellings are progressively under occupied and households rely on individual motorized vehicle for the larger share of their mobility. Consequently achieving low carbon energy represents an important challenge for those territories. This paper is part of an ongoing research about peripheral neighborhoods of single family houses in Switzerland. Through the design of transformation scenarios at neighborhood scale the research wishes to assess the capacity to achieve sustainability. The evaluation relies on various indicators among which the average power in primary nonrenewable energy and greenhouse gas emissions are significant. This paper shows how housing and mobility’s energy consumption and GHG emissions vary between center and periphery in comparison with Swiss “2’000 watts’ society” targets for 2050. This study especially shows that reducing GHG emissions down to targets is a major challenge in the context of Swiss peripheral neighborhoods.,152586,"Media relations: radio, television",Les quartiers périurbains confrontés à la transition énergétique,https://www.rts.ch/play/radio/futur-anterieur/audio/futur-anterieur-les-quartiers-periurbains-confrontes-a-la-transition-energetique?id=9595143,2018,High SI familiarity (and/or high overall SI stats),10,40ies,d,8,Y,NA,7,7,7,7,2,Y,NA,Y,NA,NA,NA,2,1,1,2,1,1,0,cocr,contr,cons,contr,cons,cons,NA,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,N,Y,7,3,3,3,3,7,7,att,att,awar,und,und,beh,und,NA,5,NA,Y,NA,NA,5,5,5,5,7,5,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,98,98,98

The current project was dedicated to the completion and calibration of a vertical wind tunnel and to the experiments on particle settling velocity (in collaboration with the Ecole d'ingénieurs de Genève CMEFE - Groupe de compétences en mécanique des fluides et procédés énergétiques/IMEC). Preliminary lab and field tests of particle aggregation were also carried out. Motivation: Processes of particle aggregation play a fundamental role in the sedimentation of tephra from volcanic plumes and, in particular, in the sedimentation of the fine-ash fraction (<63 microns). Unfortunately, even though numerical models typically used to describe tephra transport and sedimentation have now reached a high level of sophistication, an accurate and versatile parameterization of particle aggregation does not exist. Previous experimental investigations have resulted in empirical parameterizations of particle aggregation that cannot be generalized to provide a comprehensive aggregation model. This has important implications on long-term hazard assessments of tephra sedimentation, real-time forecast of ash-rich plumes and health-hazard assessments. Goal and specific objectives: With this new proposal we plan to develop a comprehensive parameterization for particle aggregation that can be implemented in dispersal models of volcanic ash, both for real-time forecasting and long-term planning. Specific objectives include: 1) to investigate dry and wet aggregation processes over time; 2) to investigate the relative effect of turbulence with respect to differential particle-settling velocity; 3) to investigate the effects of water content and particle size, concentration, composition and porosity on the formation of aggregates; 4) to determine aggregation features in the field during tephra fall at Sakurajima volcano, Japan and combine them with aircraft measurements and information on the electric field of the associated volcanic cloud; 5) to advance in our understanding of how ash aggregation processes may influence the stratigraphic record.  Methods: We are planning to run lab experiments for both dry and wet aggregation using our dedicated vertical wind tunnel equipped with state-of-the-art measuring sensors. We are particularly interested in investigating aggregation processes over time in order to understand what controls the growth rate of particle clusters. In addition, we are also planning to carry out field observations of particle aggregation (both ground and atmospheric based) at Sakurajima volcano, Japan, characterized by frequent cycles of Vulcanian explosions and ash-rich fallout. The project team is particularly well-qualified because it includes experts in the characterization and modelling of tephra deposits (Prof. C Bonadonna), aerodynamics sciences (Prof. P Haas), field and atmospheric characterization of ash aggregation (Dr A Durant) and airborne investigations using research aircrafts (Prof K Weber). Scientific relevance and broader impact: Objectives of this proposal are in line with the main research priorities identified during the first two IUGG-WMO workshops on Ash Dispersal Forecast and Civil Aviation (2010-2013). This guarantees the high scientific level of the project and the active role of the University of Geneva within the international Community. Dissemination of the project outcomes will be facilitated by the MeMoVolc, NEMOH and VERTIGO European networks for which Prof. C. Bonadonna is in the Steering/Supervisory Board Committee.

During this program the construction of a few prototypes started: a small size telescope structure with single mirror (SST-1M) is now in Krakow waiting for the mirror and camera installation and a FlashCam camera for middle size telescopes (MSTs) is under construction. In the meanwhile, FACT, which is the precursor of the CTA SSTs using silicon photosensors rather than traditionally employed photomultipliers, started data taking.The Swiss Institutions intend to transit from the Design phase into the pre-production phase, when first prototypes of Swiss in-kind contributions to CTA will be tested andtheir production will start. This proposal will bring Swiss institutions into the production phase. The CTA schedule foresees the start of the preparation of the site in mid-2016. In order to be ready for the first light observations, the telescope camera needs to undergo numerous tests before installation on the telescope structure.  The calibration strategies, the databases, the stream from raw to calibrated data and the monitoring system need to be developed, the data analysis pipeline and the control software of the telescopes need to be tested and interfaced to the full array.These topics are the subject of this Sinergia program, together with the exploitation of the FACT prototype.This work will create also the basis for a data centre to store the high-level science data of CTA in Switzerland for which initial computing hardware is requested.The request is to fund the work of 26 scientists (11.6 FTE) in the CTA Consortium which counts 375 total FTE. Principally we request funds for the continuation of postdocs already working in CTA and one PhD student to establish all steps of the data analysis with the first SST prototype jointly with FACT. The requested manpower is essential for the work on the construction program funded by FLARE.The funds will cover the shipment and installation of the SST-1M prototype on site, its commissioning and maintenance, the maintenance of FACT, computing hardware on and off site for operation of the telescopes, hardware for tests of the camera prototypes, andalso the traveling of postdocs, staff scientists and of the PhD student for CTA plenary meetings, for the project institutional meetings and for the Swiss operation contribution to the CTA GmbH legal entity.All hardware and operation contributions requested here do not overlap with the FLARE obtained funds, which had to be cut due to budget limitation with respect to submitted requests.",563847,0000-0001-5014-2152,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication;Research Infrastructures;Exchange of personnel;Industry/business/other use-inspired collaboration",Switzerland,01.10.2015,31.03.2019,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),Flux Distribution of Gamma-Ray Emission in Blazars: The Example of Mrk 501,"Romoli Carlo,  Chakraborty Nachiketa,  Dorner Daniela,  Taylor Andrew,  Blank Michael,  H.E.S.S.

All three research topics involve close-knit collaborations with groups in biology and/or human medicine.  The first part of the proposal follows up on initial observations made with Dr. D. Beerhouwen, MD of the UCLA Medical School. This has led to a positive outcome during the previous funding period:  the identification of an AmB conjugate that in combination with a fusion protein derived from modified streptavidin and a brain transport peptide crosses the blood brain barrier in therapeutic concentrations capable of reducing the CFU count for Streptococcus neoformans in murine brain and lung tissue.  We propose to follow up on this exciting result for the development of effective for treatment of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis. Two mechanistic options will be relied upon for entrance into the brain:  Receptor Mediated Transport along with Adsorptive Mediated Transcytosis. The second subproject stems from collaborations with Professor A. Trokla of the University of Zürich School of Medicine. Its aims are to prepare AmB conjugates with heparin mimics to target a specific loop in the gp 120 protein, and it is expected that these will interfere with HIV infection. The successful breakthroughs include the production of an AmB anion conjugate as well as a general route to well-defined oligosaccharides that can be cationic or anionic.  The final subproject follows up on work carried out during the previous funding period aimed at developing chemoproteomic technology to enable the study of the cell surfasome.  A key outcome from the previous funding period is the design and synthesis of a third generation chemoproteomic reagents tailor made for the use of small ligands with enhanced sensitivity. Each of the projects has broader implications beyond the immediate objectives. The first has the potential to provide a more general approach to designing small molecule therapeutics that access the brain. The second project includes extensive chemical synthesis studies with the goal of identifying novel mimics for structurally well-defined heparins. With the third project, the development of cell surface capturing technology to include small molecule ligands would provide great opportunities for drug discovery and development in academia and industry.",75820,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",United States of America,01.01.2017,31.12.2019,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,High SI familiarity (and/or high overall SI stats),10,50ies,e,10,Y,NA,8,10,9,10,2,NA,NA,NA,Y,NA,NA,2,2,1,0,2,1,2,cocr,cocr,cons,NA,contr,cons,colla,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,Y,Y,10,10,8,8,3,7,9,beh,att,und,awar,awar,awar,beh,NA,7,Y,NA,Y,NA,9,3,8,8,4,10,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,10,10

It has a high impact on human and animal health, but only little is known about its pathogenesis. Intriguingly, neurolisteriosis apparently occurs in various phenotypes. In ruminants only rhombencephalitis occurs, whilst humans may be affected by meningitis, meningoencephalitis, brain abscesses and rhombencephalitis. The purpose of thie grant proposal is to take profit of the synergy of three research groups in order to comparatively and integratively study human and ruminant neurolisteriosis on the level of the host (neurolisteriosis phenotypes), pathogen (microbiology) and experimental models (molecular pathophysiology of neurotropism). The correlation of human and ruminant epidemiological, clinical, imaging and neuropathology data with genetic data of the field strains and the investigation in experimental models will allow us to identify (novel) bacterial virulence factors, which determine CNS tropism and invasion. To this end, we will exploit the apparent similarities and differences in ruminant and cattle neurolisteriosis that indicate the ability of LM to reach the brain by various strategies. The synergistic effect and strength of this project are the common scientific interests of the groups involved and the complementarities of their fields of expertise, available material and techniques. The benefit expected of this comparative and complementary approach is a deeper understanding of the molecular neuropathogenesis of LM.Unraveling how LM, a widely studied model pathogen, targets the CNS via various pathways is crucial to understand the pathophysiology of CNS infections with intracellular microbes. Our studies are expected to enable the future development of new therapeutic strategies that aim to prevent LM from invading and spreading within the CNS. Additionally, they generate important information on the molecular epidemiology and phylogeny of human and ruminant CNS strains in the field in comparison to LM strains of other origin possibly identifying neurotropic LM genotypes. These data will enable future studies investigating the spread of neurotropic strains in the livestock population, environment and food and will facilitate surveillance and prevention of infection in both ruminants and humans.",9635,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication;Research Infrastructures",Switzerland,01.01.2014,31.01.2018,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,High SI familiarity (and/or high overall SI stats),7,70p,e,7,Y,NA,8,7,7,10,2,NA,NA,NA,Y,NA,NA,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,colla,cons,cons,contr,cons,cons,cons,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,N,Y,8,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,awar,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,8,NA,Y,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,9,NA,2

Im Rahmen dieses übergeordneten Themenfelds interessiert spezifisch die normative Forschungsfrage, ob ein Menschenrecht auf Demokratie philosophisch begründet werden kann. Nach einer systematischen Analyse und dem vergleichenden Kritik der Positionen, welche die aktuelle politikphilosophische Debatte prägen, wird in dieser Arbeit eine eigene Position entwickelt, die sich auf eine Kombination der liberalen Menschenrechtstheorie von James Griffin und der sozialphilosophischen Anerkennungstheorie von Axel Honneth stützt. Es wird von der Hypothese ausgegangen, wonach ein Menschenrecht auf Demokratie trotz des hohen Stellenwerts, den diese als Regierungsform und gemeinsame Praxis für die einzelnen Mitglieder einer politischen Gemeinschaft hat, moralphilosophisch nicht konsistent begründet werden kann. Argumentiert wird zunächst dafür, dass a) das Konzept der Demokratie nicht auf das Verhältnis zwischen dem Rechte zugestehenden Staat und dem Rechte einfordernden Individuum reduzierbar ist, und b) die instrumentellen Begründungsversuche eines Menschenrechts auf Demokratie nicht als genuines Instrument zum Schutz und zur Garantie der individuellen Freiheitsrechte eingestuft werden können. Die insbesondere in der international ausgerichteten Politischen Philosophie verbreitete Forderung nach einem Menschenrecht auf Demokratie wird jedoch nicht in toto abgelehnt, sondern zum Anlass für die Anschlussfrage genommen, welche Elemente des Gesamtkonzepts der Demokratie dessen Attraktivität im menschenrechtlichen Diskurs ausmachen und sich tatsächlich unmittelbar auf die wesentlichen Fähigkeiten und Möglichkeiten des Menschen, seine „normative agency“, auswirken. Als Annahme dient, dass das Gesamtkonzept der Demokratie Elemente wie Partizipation oder Inklusion des Einzelnen in die Gesellschaft enthält (vgl. Cohen 2005; Barber 2003), die sich als Menschenrechte formulieren und einfordern lassen. Der Vorschlag einer menschenrechtlichen Einforderung extrahierter Elemente des Konzepts der Demokratie soll im anwendungsorientierten Schlussteil der Arbeit am Fallbeispiel der Migration dargestellt und geprüft werden. Die moralphilosophische Begründung von politischen und sozialen Teilnahmerechten wird durch die Kombination des liberalen menschenrechtstheoretischen Ansatzes von James Griffin mit dem anerkennungstheoretischen Ansatz von Axel Honneth auch im Hinblick auf die Möglichkeit einer verstärkten globalen Verrechtlichung dieses Menschenrechts im gegenwärtigen politischen Kontext substantiell erweitert.",31676,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results",Germany,01.07.2013,30.06.2016,Peer-reviewed,Original article (peer-reviewed),Moral and political conceptions of human rights: rethinking the distinction,Horn Anita,Published,2016,,10.1080/13642987.2016.1147433                                                                       ,,The International Journal of Human Rights,,The International Journal of Human Rights,20,6,724,743,The International Journal of Human Rights,,In one important strand of the philosophical debate human rights are seen as a practical benchmark to evaluate and orient matters of national politics international relations and global governance. The article investigates the possible benefits and problems of this approach. Problematising the well established distinction between moral and political human rights in philosophical human rights debate the author follows Paolo Gilabert's attempt to alternatively discuss human rights under the perspective of rights having both an abstract and a specific dimension. Discussing the (self )understanding of the contemporary human being as representing the subject of human rights Axel Honneth's recognition theory is applied to concretise Gilabert's humanist claim to do justice to the ‘essentially social’ nature of the human being.

This topic is of great theoretical significance for political science and public administration theory, because until now, research on the relationship between specific attributes of political systems and the practice and institutionalization of policy evaluation is missing. It is also of great practical relevance, because considerable resources are invested in evaluations each year, and we need to know how to best make use of this investment and how to avoid negative consequences. To link attributes of policy evaluation with policy, polity, and politics in a comprehensive approach is considered as an innovative and fruitful research track. The Swiss political system is ideal for studying this question: Firstly, it has a high degree of internal heterogeneity that allows for within-system comparisons. Secondly, two attributes of the Swiss political system are of special relevance for policy evaluation, namely: federalism and direct democracy. Some scholars claim that federalism increases the demand for evaluations, others argue the opposite, and the same is true for direct democracy. A similar lack of consensus exists with respect to the influence of policy evaluation on the Swiss political system. In addition, a systematic analysis of interdependencies between attributes of the Swiss political system and evaluation is lacking, especially at the subnational level. Therefore, the proposed Sinergia project intends to analyze these relationships through comparisons at the cantonal level, and by using longitudinal and cross-sectional, inter-policy comparison. In detail, the following four subprojects constitute the Sinergia proposal: Subproject 1, led by A. Balthasar (University of Lucerne) and F. Varone (University of Geneva), asks about the relevance of policy sector and administrative unit attributes for policy evaluation by comparing twenty cases (1990-2011) in education, health, energy and public transport policy from four cantons and the Federation. Subproject 2, directed by K. Horber-Papazian (IDHEAP Lausanne) and A. Flückiger (University of Geneva), analyzes the reasons for and the consequences of evaluation clauses in federal and cantonal laws. The study consists of a comprehensive survey and analysis of current (2011) obligations to conduct evaluations in all federal and cantonal laws. Subproject 3, managed by F. Sager and V. Friedrich (both University of Berne), concentrates on direct democracy and asks about the use of evaluations in direct democratic campaigns. The focus is on education and health policy at the cantonal and federal level. An extensive survey of all votes at cantonal and federal levels from 1990 to 2011 will be conducted, as well as eight case studies of selected campaigns. Subproject 4, run by T. Widmer and K. Frey (both University of Zurich), analyses the relationships between policy evaluation and parliaments at the cantonal and federal levels by conducting a survey among the about 3’000 members of parliament at both levels. Multi-level data analyses will be conducted, as will a comparison of 27 cases (3 policies from 3 policy sectors (education, health and energy policy) in 3 cantons). Since the four subprojects share common concepts and are coordinated empirically (common time periods, policy sectors and cantons examined), the synergy potential of the proposed project is high, especially with respect to data collection. Collaboration and exchange will be facilitated by meetings between the team members, in the earlier part of the project, to discuss the progress that has been made, and by organizing two events later on to reach broader audiences (researchers, practitioners, the public) that are intended to communicate research findings and transfer knowledge gained. The international audience will be informed through publications in high-quality journals, and the project contributes to the promotion of young academics by supporting eight PhD positions.",48164,,NA,NA,NA,NA,Peer-reviewed,Contribution to book (peer-reviewed),Die Evaluationstätigkeit in der Schweiz: ausgewählte Entwicklungen im Vergleich,"Frey Kathrin,  Di Giorgi Vanessa,  Widmer Thomas",Published,2017,978-3-03810-244-1,,,Evaluation im politischen System der Schweiz,"NZZ Libro,Zurich",Evaluation im politischen System der Schweiz,,,67,88,Evaluation im politischen System der Schweiz,,,141893,"Media relations: print media, online media",Wissenschaft schafft eine bessere Demokratie.,https://www.nzz.ch/meinung/march-for-science-wissenschaft-schafft-eine-bessere-demokratie-ld.1287660,2017,High SI familiarity (and/or high overall SI stats),7,50ies,e,7,Y,NA,3,9,6,8,2,Y,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,1,2,2,1,2,2,colla,cons,contr,contr,cons,contr,contr,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,Y,Y,7,6,7,7,7,8,7,awar,awar,att,att,att,beh,att,NA,8,Y,NA,Y,changes in behaviour of public administrationsenation,7,5,7,7,4,6,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,8,8,6

Laser-produced plasmas are a well established method for generating radiation in a broad range of wavelengths. The interaction of a high power laser with a specific target material has been used to generate photon emission in a variety of spectral regions including hard X-Rays, soft X-Rays, ultraviolet radiation including vacuum ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet and visible radiation. The main field of application of the present work is related to the use of LPP sources for X-ray lithography, and more precisely for extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. At the Laboratory for Energy Conversion (LEC), ETH Zürich, a fully functional high power, tin droplet-based LPP light source has been developed over the last 7 years. The major challenges, which are found in the development of a soft X-ray LPP source, include the source emission stability, the source power and brightness, as well as the mitigation of plasma debris. These challenges are representative for the other fields of application of soft X-ray light sources. For the source plasma, the LEC ALPS group has already performed 3D mapping of EUV emissions and 2D ion mapping. The next step will be ultrafast imaging of the droplet breakup for different time intervals. The PhD student shall perform an experimental study with the actual liquid droplet target in conjunction with the already accomplished plasma diagnostics, providing a complete measured characterization of the plasma dynamics for a droplet-based LPP source. The proposed study would provide insight into the process of droplet spallation.The PhD student shall perform an experimental study of pre-pulse shaping. Sending a laser pre-pulse before the main laser drive pulse to the droplet target can increase the conversion efficiency (CE) of the source and mitigate debris by controlling droplet breakup and target expansion. There is high interest in being able to temporally compress the pre-pulse. A temporally compressed pre-pulse increases the source conversion efficiency at lower pre-pulse powers. Additionally, the potential for target shaping with picosecond pulse trains will be explored utilizing an electro-optic deflector or a specialized pulsed picosecond laser. Beyond providing further insight into droplet spallation, these experiments in picosecond pulse trains will shed light on the effect of periodic shockwaves on the breakup of liquid droplets.In the final phase the PhD student shall perform an experimental study of laser pre-pulse compression utilizing Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS). SBS has been demonstrated as a viable method of temporally compressing 1064nm Nd:YAG high energy laser pulses and is the chosen approach for this work. Fluorocarbons have shown the greatest potential for compression of an Nd:YAG laser. A parametric study will be performed on the effect of pre-pulse compression on the LPP source plasma dynamics.The knowledge acquired of the plasma dynamics during the project will have a significant overall impact on the field of laser-produced plasmas.",520556,,NA,NA,NA,NA,Peer-reviewed,Proceedings (peer-reviewed),Laser induced shockwave droplet breakup dynamics,"Hudgins Duane,  Nieland Alex,  Abhari Reza S.",Published,2017,,,https://www.euvlitho.com/2017/S52.pdf,2017 Source Workshop,"EUV Litho, Inc.,Austin, TX USA",2017 Source Workshop,,,,,2017 Source Workshop,"Dublin, Ireland",,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,High SI familiarity (and/or high overall SI stats),10,50ies,e,8,Y,NA,4,8,9,5,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,Y,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,cons,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,N,N,6,4,0,0,0,1,7,other,other,NA,NA,NA,NA,und,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,7,0,0,0,0,8,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,9,NA,NA

Pour cette approche, les effets de sens des morphèmes grammaticaux émergent dans l’interprétation online sous la pression combinée du contexte linguistique, du contexte extra-linguistique (l’environnement cognitif) et de principes cognitifs (pragmatiques) généraux orientant l’inférence vers sa meilleure cible, définie en termes de pertinence (Sperber & Wilson 1995). Les morphèmes temporels verbaux des langues indo-européennes présentent à la fois :i) une variété d’emplois qui sont souvent laissés pour compte comme déviants vis-à-vis de canons d’emploi auxquels ils dérogent, car ils ciblent une autre temporalité que celle qui leur est attribuée par la sémantique; ils sont donc sont inattendus pour une théorie grammaticale qui doit les résoudre pragmatiquement alors qu’elle ne dispose pas de l’équipement théorique pour y parvenir ; etii) des restrictions d’emploi (parfois très imparfaitement documentées dans la littérature) qui empêchent d’adopter le point de vue qui en ferait des fourre-tout pragmatiques ou de penser qu’ils seraient radicalement affranchis d’une valeur temporelle racine.De ces deux contraintes résulte le considérant selon lequel il s’agit d’expressions procédurales (au sens de Blakemore 1987 et 2007, Nicolle 1998, Moeschler 1998, Blass 1990 mais surtout de Saussure 2003, 2006, 2010 et 2011), i.e. qui encodent non pas une signification unaire (par exemple une simple combinaison de coordonnées référentielles) mais un parcours inférentiel qui détermine les effets de sens obtenus en fonction de données extérieures (contextuelles) et de la satisfaction des critères cognitifs de pertinence. Les expressions procédurales se distinguent des expressions conceptuelles en ceci que ces dernières font l’objet d’une détermination pragmatique du sens en contexte selon des procédures pragmatiques générales de modulation pragmatique alors que les expressions procédurales, radicalement irréductibles à du matériel conceptuel en elles-mêmes, déterminent ex ante les types d’enrichissement inférentiel auxquels elles peuvent donner lieu et qui sont en nombre limité et imprédictible par des critères généraux.  C’est à dérouler ces procédures en détail et de manière systématique sur les temps de l’italien, à la suite de ce qui a été fait sur le français (cf. Saussure 2003 et les travaux suivants de cette approche), qu’est consacré ce projet, hébergé au Centre de recherches cognitives de l’Université de Neuchâtel et dont la recherche linguistique sera largement assumée par une linguiste post-doc native de l’italien. Outre la contribution de ce projet à la recherche fondamentale sur la langue italienne, ce projet vise à des retombées significatives dans le domaine de la didactique de l’italien L2 et de l’enseignement scolaire.

SUMMARYThe present proposal aims to understand the fascinating ability of S. aureus to colonize and adapt successively to different hosts, using the recent human-bovine jump of S. aureus clonal cluster CC8 as a model system.  Understanding cross-species jump of S. aureus is a nagging question that has recent precedents in human and poultry and human and pigs. During host jump, S. aureus may acquire movable genetic elements (MGEs) that confer it indispensable features to survive in the new host, or lose elements that are indispensable to colonize the first host but became deleterious in the new one. This is exemplified by the acquisition of prophage phiSAB during the passage from human to poultry, and the loss of phiSA3 - which is important to colonize humans but not animals - during the passage from human to poultry or human to pigs. Moreover, along its journey from one host to another, S. aureus may also acquire additional genes, such antibiotic-resistance genes or toxin genes. These more generalist genes may become problematic for the whole human and veterinary medical community. We recently described a human-bovine host jump of S. aureus CC8, a lineage that contains the notoriously virulent methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) USA300. Here we propose to study in depth the genomic and mechanistic correlates underlying this jump. The opportunity is unique for several reasons. First, it occurred rather recently and therefore the microbial genomes are not biased by prolonged divergent evolution. Second, the genetic differences between bovine and human isolates are still relatively circumscribed. They implicate two main MGEs, i.e. a new staphylococcal chromosome cassette (SCC) devoid of mecA but carrying a new LPXTG protein, and the loss of phiSA3. Third, we have the genetic and molecular tools to test the implications of these elements for host specificity as a whole. Fourth, the event is apparently predominant in Switzerland, and we have acquired a large collection of CC8 isolates from both bovine and human origin.We plan a four-step experimental schedule. First by generalizing genomic comparison (for SCC, phiSA3 and other differences) to a whole collection of bovine and human CC8 isolates via microarray-analysis and total genome sequencing. Second, by comparing phenotypes of bovine and human CC8 isolates, including gene expression at the mRNA and proteomic levels, and comparing in vitro and ex vivo colonization and invasion properties in tissue cultures. Third, by constructing recombinant S. aureus deleted or complemented in SCC or phiSA3, and expressing relevant genes heterologously in L. lactis to clarify their function in phenotypic tests. Fourth by completing a new field study to learn more on the epidemiological makeup of bovine and human CC8 in the farm environment, especially regarding to the reservoir of strains and the reservoir of the SCC cassette.Understanding the CC8 human-bovine jump is very attractive from both the biology and veterinary and human medicine points of view. Indeed, bovine CC8 appear more aggressive than typical bovine CCs in herds. Thus, the detection of CC8 clones in mastitis should warn veterinarians for scrutiny. Moreover, bovine CC8 carry a SCC cassette, which may pose three additional problems. First, it is a close homolog of SCCmec cassettes found in human MRSA (e.g. USA300 and COL), and could very well acquire the mecA element or other antibiotic resistance or virulence genes along evolution, which could then lead to a bovine-MRSA epidemic. Second, because SCC is mobile, it could be passed to other bovine CCs. Finally, because CC8 presumably jumped from humans to cows, it could possibly make the reverse jump and carry new SCCmec cassette into human medicine, similarly to well-known swine CC398.  For all these reasons, studying the CC8 human-to-bovine host jump does not only represent an academic opportunity to understand biology, but also to learn more on human and veterinary epidemiology in order to prevent the spread of infectious diseases and antibiotic-resistance.",22112,,"in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results;Publication",Switzerland,01.11.2012,31.07.2017,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,High SI familiarity (and/or high overall SI stats),6,60ies,e,7,Y,NA,6,9,9,5,1,NA,NA,Y,Y,NA,NA,2,2,0,0,1,1,0,contr,contr,NA,NA,cons,NA,NA,1,0,1,0,NA,1,0,0,0,1,N,Y,6,6,2,0,0,6,9,und,NA,NA,NA,NA,und,und,NA,6,Y,NA,NA,NA,8,3,3,3,3,8,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,7,8,7

Current systems that solve these tasks typically require speech to be acquired by a close-mounted microphone from well-controlled acoustic environments and fail in realistically-changing environments with added noise, natural room reverberations, and competing talkers. By contrast, none of these realistic situations present significant difficulty to human speech communication. The representations chosen by biological systems appear to be tuned to the statistics of natural sounds, both reflecting the overall distribution of these sounds and adapting to their local statistics on a range of timescales.  By contrast, the first stages of present engineering systems tend to be off-the-shelf signal processing algorithms, with no sensitivity to global or local sound statistics.Our goal is to build a new front-end processor for sounds that extracts in real-time features based on these biological principles in a way that is resistant to the presence of distractors and noise; to integrate this front-end with state-of-the-art speech-processing algorithms; to allow for adaptation of this front-end based on changes in input statistics; and to build a robust, real-time, compact hardware implementation of this sound processing system. We take advantage of recent developments in computational source streaming models, bio-inspired feature extraction methods which depend on the input statistics, advances in neuromorphic sensor technology, and embedded systems for real-time performance. These developments provide a unique opportunity to combine knowledge in these different areas to construct a novel acoustic processing system. We will validate this system on a task relating to aspects of human speech in different environments including other talkers and reverberance.This project intends to achieve two important objectives: first, it will advance the state of the art of machine speech recognition by using algorithms that determine acoustic features based on the statistics of the environments and the temporal coherence observed in the auditory cortex; and second, it will build a real-time source streaming system composed of a continuous-time sensor front end coupled to standard digital architectures such as microprocessors or FPGA boards, for easy reconfiguration of the system architecture. The operation of the system in real-time allows for exploration of biologically inspired acoustic algorithms that can also be used in embedded applications like hand-held devices and for use in setups for scientific behavioral experiments.

Automatic speaker verification is a subtest of speaker recognition task where the goal is to verify or authenticate a person. State-of-the-art speaker verification systems typically model short-term spectrum based features such as mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) through a generative model such as, Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and employ a series of compensation methods to achieve low error rates. This has two main limitations. First, the approach necessitates availability of sufficient training data for each speaker for robust modeling and sufficient test data to apply the series of compensation techniques to verify a speaker. Second,  the speaker verification system is prone to malicious attacks such as through voice conversion (VC) system, text-to-speech (TTS) system. The main reason is that the front-end feature and back-end models of speaker verification system, namely, MFCC and GMMs, are similar to that of VC system and TTS system.The proposed project aims to address these limitations through development of novel approaches for trustworthy speaker verification. In order to achieve that, through collaboration between researchers from Speech and Audio Processing group and Biometrics group at Idiap, the proposed project focuses along two lines,1. in on-going DeepSTD project funded by HASLER foundation, in the context of speech recognition, it was shown that speech recognition systems can be built by directly modeling raw speech signals using artificial neural networks. The proposed project aims to build on that approach to develop a generic speaker verification approach that can be used for both speaker verification and speaker diarization.2. in a collaborative study with researchers from Univesity of Eastern Finland and Nanyang Technical University (Singapore), Idiap have developed a countermeasure approach for state-of-the-art speaker verification system. The proposed project aims to extend this approach along with development of novel anti-spoofing countermeasures using binary features and text-dependent speaker verification.",118479,,Exchange of personnel,Spain,01.07.2015,30.06.2019,Peer-reviewed,Proceedings (peer-reviewed),End-to-End Convolutional Neural Network-based Voice Presentation Attack Detection,"Muckenhirn Hannah,  Magimai.-Doss Mathew,  Marcel Sébastien",Published,2017,,,http://publications.idiap.ch/downloads/papers/2017/Muckenhirn_IJCB_2017.pdf,Proceedings of International Joint Conference on Biometrics,"IEEE,IEEEXplore",Proceedings of International Joint Conference on Biometrics,,,,,Proceedings of International Joint Conference on Biometrics,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,High SI familiarity (and/or high overall SI stats),7,40ies,e,7,Y,NA,3,10,8,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,Y,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,contr,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,NA,NA,N,N,0,5,0,0,0,0,10,NA,und,NA,NA,NA,NA,und,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10,1,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,9,NA,NA
