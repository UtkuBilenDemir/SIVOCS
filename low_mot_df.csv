In this respect, our project is highly relevant, despite the fact that we mainly analyze historical sources through the lens of film, TV and literary narratives. Therefore, SNSF can only continue carefully to choose diverse projects in terms of theories, disciplines, research objectives and cultural/geohistorical contexts.","","When we started our HK project in 2004, Hong Kong was one of the most innovative urban communities. Despite still being under British colonial rule, the community thrived. Today, under PRC rulership, there is massive social unrest and insecurity, especially among the young population, about political participation, job opportunities and the future as a whole. To study the coming of age experience during the 1950s meant to us to understand how British colonial rule was gradually transformed into an accountable political system by the highly educated society. It seems that, with the Chinese decolonizers, HKers are led back to the ""roaring"" 1960s in some way or another. We did not expect this development and will carry on with our observation and analysis of cultural responses with regard to the special sociopolitical situation in HK.",NA,3057.42,23.38,NA,NA,NA,14.1,NA,59.97,NA,NA,NA,67.53,NA,NA,NA,63.44,NA,NA,NA,45.15,NA,NA,NA,113.12,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,89.96,NA,NA,2580.77,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Andrea","Riemenschnitter","andrea.riemenschnitter@aoi.uzh.ch",507754,"female",153590,"Coming of age in Hong Kong: a study of a colonial literary field in the 1950s","Other languages and literature","Project funding (Div.

This research provides a narrative that exposes the very restricted view that most humans have of sexuality. While evolution has led to the emergence of two fundamental sexual strategies, namely making many small germ cells (the male sexual strategy) or making fewer large germ cells (the female sexual strategy), these do not always map onto (lifelong) male and female individuals. Instead, these fundamental strategies can be expressed by the same individual, either sequentially (in sex changing organisms) or at the same time (in simultaneous hermaphrodites). Our research has documented extensive quantitative variation in the amounts allocated to the male and female side of a simultaneous hermaphrodite, and identified important predictors of this variation.","It is fundamental research that has provided the basis for human development and advancement.
