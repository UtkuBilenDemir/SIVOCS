In this respect, our project is highly relevant, despite the fact that we mainly analyze historical sources through the lens of film, TV and literary narratives. Therefore, SNSF can only continue carefully to choose diverse projects in terms of theories, disciplines, research objectives and cultural/geohistorical contexts.","","When we started our HK project in 2004, Hong Kong was one of the most innovative urban communities. Despite still being under British colonial rule, the community thrived. Today, under PRC rulership, there is massive social unrest and insecurity, especially among the young population, about political participation, job opportunities and the future as a whole. To study the coming of age experience during the 1950s meant to us to understand how British colonial rule was gradually transformed into an accountable political system by the highly educated society. It seems that, with the Chinese decolonizers, HKers are led back to the ""roaring"" 1960s in some way or another. We did not expect this development and will carry on with our observation and analysis of cultural responses with regard to the special sociopolitical situation in HK.",NA,3057.42,23.38,NA,NA,NA,14.1,NA,59.97,NA,NA,NA,67.53,NA,NA,NA,63.44,NA,NA,NA,45.15,NA,NA,NA,113.12,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,89.96,NA,NA,2580.77,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Andrea","Riemenschnitter","andrea.riemenschnitter@aoi.uzh.ch",507754,"female",153590,"Coming of age in Hong Kong: a study of a colonial literary field in the 1950s","Other languages and literature","Project funding (Div.

Social innovation should be clearly stated in the broader impact section or in a dedicated section of SNSF proposals. This would both promote social innovation and make scientists more aware of various aspects of social innovation. In fact, most scientific projects promote social innovation even if scientists might not always be fully aware of it. This is a missed opportunity for both science and society. In order to inspire scientists to promote social innovation with their projects, various examples of social innovation could be illustrated on the SNSF website and various workshops and webinars could be organized with teams of experts. Social innovation should not be perceived by scientists as an obligation but as an opportunity and an added value. In fact, proposals should not be penalized if social innovation is not adequately addressed. However, in case of acceptance of the project, examples of social-innovation activities could be proposed to the PIs by a team of SNSF experts.","For both my two lines of research (dispersal and sedimentation of volcanic particles and assessment of volcanic risk) I found that operational agencies and decision makers were more inclined to implement scientific innovation in their policies if they were actively involved in project publication and/or organization of dedicated workshops instead of just being informed of the project results.
Local workshops also worked very well to engage with various local groups (e.g. general public, stake holders, decision makers). In fact, through these workshops various social groups felt more empowered and motivated to increase their preparedness to face natural hazards. 
","What I did not full expect from the social innovation of my projects is how the engagement we had at the local level (e.g. workshops, interviews, informal discussions) actually triggered spontaneous activities in the local community and favoured interaction amongst various social groups that otherwise would not have happened. 
I was also positively surprised by how international scientists that were invited to the local workshops could appreciate the importance of sharing project results with the local communities, which is not common practice in our scientific community.
