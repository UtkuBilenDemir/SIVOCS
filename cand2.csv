As more and more people flee to Europe, the refugee receiving countries are faced with a fundamental challenge: how best to integrate the massive number of asylum seekers who have been or will be granted some form of refugee status and often remain in the country for good. Although European countries will not be able to stop the wave of refugees, they can develop and implement policies that facilitate their rapid and effective integration. Because researchers have not systematically studied the causal impacts of asylum and refugee policies on refugee integration, we know distressingly little about what works and what does not when it comes to enhancing the integration of refugees through better policies. Subsequently, policymakers across Europe have no concrete evidence to make informed decisions about redesigning the asylum process.Our proposed research will start addressing this gap and provide the first comprehensive assessment of how key policy parameters of the asylum process affect the integration of asylum seekers who have been granted some form of refugee or refugee-like status in Switzerland. We will investigate the impact of wait times, regulations while waiting (e.g., labor market restrictions and welfare support) and the impact of targeted cantonal refugee integration programs. By merging high quality register panel data from different administrative sources and applying various quasi-experimental research designs, we are able to quantify the short and long-term causal effects of these core policies on a wide range of important integration outcomes including unemployment, income, permanent residency permits, intermarriage, and naturalization and also assess how the effects of these policy parameters vary across different groups of refugees.We have conducted an extensive pilot study on asylum decision wait times which underscores the feasibility of our approach and demonstrates that even small administrative changes to reduce the wait times of the asylum decision can have a significant impact on improving the economic integration of refugees with temporary protection, and as a result reduce the fiscal burden on government and ultimately taxpayers. Building off this preliminary research, we can generate actionable knowledge regarding the asylum process using an economical and robust research approach that will help place Switzerland at the forefront of asylum and refugee research, and position Switzerland to most effectively respond to the refugee crisis by understanding the policy conditions which help or hurt refugees to become integrated and productive members of the Swiss community. The lessons from the Swiss case will provide invaluable insights into the impact of the asylum process that will be informative for policymakers across Europe.Importantly, this research project is shovel-ready. Our research team has the scientific track record, methodological skills, and substantive expertise to unearth the causal effect of asylum procedures from the comprehensive and high quality Swiss register data, we have secured the official support of the State Secretariat for Migration to assure efficient and ethical collection of this administrative data, and all we lack is the financial support of the Swiss National Science Foundation to implement this innovative and timely research. We are confident that the policy implications of our findings have immediate and practical impact on the (re-)design of asylum policies in Switzerland and Europe more generally.","Political science","Humanities and Social Sciences;Sociology, social work, political sciences, media and communication studies, health","Institut für Politikwissenschaft Universität Zürich","Switzerland","University of Zurich - ZH","Project funding (Div.

This is part of an endeavour to use behavioural and neurobiological measures to stratify existing clinical psychopathological entities with respect to treatment outcomes. Current pharmacological depression treatment options lead to eventual remission in up to 70% of patients Rush et al. (2006). Because the risk of relapse after discontinuation is high (30-60% in 6 months; Geddes et al. 2003), guidelines recommend treatment continuation for various periods. However, physicians then face a similar problem again: (i) patients discontinue psychotropic medication independently at very high rates (Lee and Lee, 2011), particularly after achieving remission; and (ii) these recommendations do not take individual variability into account. Markers for safe ADM discontinuation would help identify at-risk patients in whom continuation or further therapy could be recommended on stronger, individually valid, grounds. By providing an objective end-point to treatment this may enhance concordance with treatment. Furthermore, although the neurobiology of affective function after remission has been examined previously, the contribution of ADM remains poorly understood and characterised. Based on a power analysis, we propose a 6-month follow-up study of patients who have been in remission for a minimum of 6 months and intend to discontinue their ADMs independently of this study. We will test the ability of three neuroimaging biomarkers in predicting early relapse. First, subjects will undergo an emotion regulation paradigm, in which they are instructed to experience or regulate their response to emotional images from the IAPS dataset. The experiencing and the regulation parts of the task will be both separately and jointly assessed to predict relapse. Several versions of the former have established validity in predicting response to treatment. The latter has been suggested to be one important characteristic of depression vulnerability. Second, subjects will undergo an established planning task that measures the impact of aversive outcomes on planning. This will be slightly modified to additionally quantify helplessness. All subjects will undergo scanning twice, and will be divided into two groups of equal size. In group 1W2, scan 1 will occur just prior to medication withdrawal, and scan 2 between 5-20 ADM half-lives after withdrawal. In group 12W, both scans will occur before withdrawal: scan 1 approx 5-20 ADM half-lives before, and scan 2 just prior to withdrawal. We will use scan 1 as the main predictor for relapse. We will use the interaction between groups and scans to examine the effect of medication withdrawal. In a subsidiary analysis, we will also use changes between scan 1 and 2 in group 1W2 to predict relapse. In all cases, we will test for incremental predictive power above and beyond clinically available measurements.","Neurophysiology and Brain Research","Biology and Medicine;Basic Medical Sciences","Institut für Biomedizinische Technik Universität Zürich und ETH Zürich","Switzerland","University of Zurich - ZH","Project funding (Div.

Here we briefly review the preclinical literature to motivate specific hypotheses about model free temporal difference learning and then review the imaging evidence in the drug of abuse with the most substantial societal consequences: alcohol. Despite the breadth of the literature only a few studies have examined the predictions directly and these provide at best inconclusive evidence for the involvement of temporal difference learning alterations in alcohol dependence.

L’étude se centrera sur l’évaluation de tâches complexes dans une approche par compétences. Dans la perspective située que la recherche adoptera, l’acte de jugement sera appréhendé à la fois comme un processus cognitif et une pratique sociale qui se réalise en interaction avec son contexte institutionnel et professionnel. Les processus de référentialisation semblent pouvoir jouer un rôle capital dans cette interaction, désignant les liens élaborés entre les référents convoqués dans les jugements évaluatifs, les critères, les indicateurs et référés soumis à évaluation. Des pratiques de « modération sociale » entre plusieurs enseignants, impliquant la confrontation de leurs jugements afin de construire une culture d’évaluation commune, sont vues comme susceptibles de renforcer la qualité des jugements évaluatifs « situés ». A partir de ces postulats, quatre buts fondent notre recherche : (1) étudier la référentialisation des jugements évaluatifs sur un plan individuel et collectif, dont l’articulation entre les référents internes et externes qui servent de repères aux enseignants. (2) Etudier les dynamiques de modération sociale et les formes de raisonnements collectifs accomplis par les enseignants quand ils confrontent leurs jugements d’évaluation et cherchent à construire un consensus. (3) Spécifier les critères de qualité des jugements évaluatifs du point de vue des acteurs de terrain, confrontés aux critères définis dans la littérature de recherche. (4) Dégager ce qui relève d’une culture commune en évaluation, afin notamment d’identifier les dimensions génériques, susceptibles d’être communes aux enseignants, et les dimensions spécifiques qui relèvent du caractère clinique et situé du jugement évaluatif.Deux groupes de neuf enseignants (7-8è Harmos) de six établissements scolaires genevois seront concernés. Le dispositif de recherche comprend trois volets : (1) observation du jugement évaluatif de chaque enseignant en train d’évaluer des copies de ses élèves (sur des contenus communs : en mathématiques, puis en français production de texte) associée à un entretien semi-directif ; (2) séances de modération sociale réunissant chaque groupe divisé en trios (première triangulation de jugements) puis confrontés entre eux (deuxième triangulation de jugements) ; les modérations sociales se fonderont sur le matériel récolté dans le volet 1 et introduiront notamment des épreuves externes opérationnalisant les attentes institutionnelles ; les modérations sociales seront suivies par un entretien individuel ; (3) nouvelle observation du jugement évaluatif de chaque enseignant (dans les mêmes disciplines), suivie d’un entretien individuel semi-directif. Les données recueillies seront les verbalisations et interactions pendant les pratiques d’évaluation individuelle et collective et pendant les entretiens, les notes d’observation, les épreuves corrigées et les traces écrites élaborées pendant les modérations sociales. Quatre modalités d’analyse des données sont prévues, soutenues par l’usage du logiciel Nvivo : une analyse thématique du corpus ; une analyse de l’activité des évaluateurs pendant la correction d’épreuves ; une analyse interactionnelle située des processus de modération sociale ; des analyses de cas. Cette recherche fait suite à une étude similaire réalisée dans les degrés 5-6è Harmos dans laquelle l’ensemble du dispositif a été testé. Dans un temps ultérieur, elle permettra une analyse longitudinale sur 4 degrés scolaires et examinera l’impact des enjeux d’orientation en fin d’école primaire.La recherche vise à produire de nouvelles connaissances sur les processus de référentialisation des jugements évaluatifs en contexte scolaire et sur les médiations susceptibles de renforcer la qualité des jugements dans des évaluations qui ont des impacts sur les parcours scolaires des élèves. Dans un contexte politique qui accorde une importance croissante aux repères externes (standards, épreuves externes, …) à des fins de pilotage du système éducatif, la pertinence de notre recherche réside dans l’étude de l’utilisation que font les enseignants des repères fournis par l’institution en interaction avec leurs propres pratiques et connaissances professionnelles. Notre recherche est appelée à fournir des éléments précieux de compréhension des pratiques évaluatives qui auront des conséquences importantes pour la formation initiale et continue des enseignants. Par la visée de transformation des pratiques à travers les modérations sociales expérimentées, des retombées sont attendues, dont la production de nouveaux outils pour les enseignants et les équipes d’établissement scolaire dans une perspective d’évaluation collaborative entre professionnels.

Developments within psychoanalysis, deconstruction, post-colonialism, and feminism have undermined the unquestioned legitimacy often attributed to authenticity as a means of asserting individual or collective identity. Nonetheless, cultural producers and promoters often deploy claims of authenticity to confer legitimacy, currency, and popular appeal. Generally depending on unempirical justification for financial underwriting and public dissemination, the arena of cultural production thus provides fertile ground through which to analyze the deployment of the trope of authenticity in contemporary society. The label of the authentic simultaneously enables artists and artifacts to appeal to both local and global audiences and to mediate new systems of social inclusion and exclusion. Bridging the ambivalent attitudes of theoretical doubt and pragmatic utilization of tropes of authenticity, this project aims to use an analysis of claims of authenticity to produce models of collective identity in a globalizing world of ever-increasing cultural flux.Under the leadership of the Center for Cultural Studies (CCS) of the University of Bern, and in cooperation with members of the Faculté des lettres at the University of Lausanne, the interdisciplinary SINERGIA project 'Theory and Practice of Authenticity in Global Cultural Production' examines the paradoxical relevance of this concept within various disciplines and cultural fields, bridging theoretical considerations and cultural practices connected to it and creating a methodology allowing for a mutual commensurability of the different discourses inhabiting the term 'authenticity.' In light of recent theoretical discussion, it addresses questions such as:-UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS, BY WHOM, AND FOR WHOM IS THE CONCEPT OF 'AUTHENTICITY' DEPLOYED, REJECTED, OR DEBATED, AND WHO PROFITS FROM IT? -DOES AUTHENTICITY STILL HAVE HEURISTIC OR HERMENEUTIC VALUE? IF NOT, HOW CAN WE EXPLAIN THE LASTING POWER OF AUTHENTICITY IN CULTURAL PRACTICE? -HOW DO CONCEPTS OF AUTHENTICITY VARY BETWEEN DISCIPLINES AND CULTURES? -HOW DO NOTIONS OF AUTHENTICITY DIFFER REGARDING OBJECTS, SUBJECTS, AND COLLECTIVES?-HOW CAN A CROSS-DISCIPLINARY METHODOLOGY BE DEVISED THROUGH WHICH TO ANALYZE THE SOCIAL FUNCTION OF THE TROPE OF 'AUTHENTICITY' IN BOTH THEORETICAL AND PRAGMATIC TERMS?The interdisciplinary institutional structure of the CCS provides unique qualification for the leadership with this project which is expanded through collaboration with the University of Lausanne. The project will not only promote and support young researchers, but will also serve as a first step toward a joint, inter-university doctoral program, as defined in the 'Projektskizze' for future doctoral programs 2014-16 circulated by the Schweizerische Universitätskonferenz (SUK). The project will use its colloquia and publications to disseminate new models of collective agency to participate in contemporary theoretical debate about the cultural production of community in the contemporary world, and will propose pragmatic uses of alternatives to the trope of authenticity for use in cultural and marketing contexts.","German and English languages and literature","Humanities and Social Sciences;Linguistics and literature, philosophy","Institut für englische Sprachen und Literaturen Universität Bern","Switzerland","University of Berne - BE","Sinergia","in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results","United States of America","01.02.2014","30.06.2018",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Media relations: radio, television","Kelteische Musik – Gibt es das überhaupt?","http://www.srf.ch/sendungen/musik-der-welt/keltische-musik-gibt-es-das-ueberhaupt-2",2016,"https://survey3.zsi.at/index.php/admin/responses/sa/view/surveyid/718586/id/167",2021-10-06 22:32:22,9,"en",1855064738,"8c3LKMsAlaX0p8f",2021-10-06 22:19:08,2021-10-06 22:32:22,"2a02:120b:2c1a:440:6d1b:7004:580a:182b",NA,"9","50ies","e",8,"Y","NA","8",9,9,9,1,"Y",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,"0","1","0","1","1","0","cocr",NA,"contr",NA,"cons","contr",NA,"0","1","1","1","1",1,0,"0","1","1","N","Y","3","3","7","1","3","2","7","awar",NA,"und",NA,"awar",NA,"att",NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,99,2,"9",7,8,7,1,"1","1","0","0","1","0","1","0","0","0","0","5","98","6",0,"How is basic Research - and yes, that exists in the Humanities as well - measurable in quantitative terms?",NA,"The fact a totally debunkt concept like authenticity still has in the cultural, as well as political discourse."

It is today both a clinical and a research tool with a large and growing spectrum of clinical applications for diagnosis and treatment monitoring of a variety of diseases. A key component of PET imaging systems are the detector modules, an area of research and development that has often seen the migration of technologies originally developed for particle physics experiments. As of today, the experience gained with the construction of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) detectors is mature to be translated into new ideas for PET technologies, provided adequate effort and resources are devoted to the task. In particular, the availability of a new generation of thin solid-state detectors based on silicon in combination with very-low noise and very fast readout electronics is now opening a new window of before unexpected opportunities. What is proposed in this SINERGIA is a compact and thin time-of-flight PET detector device with depth of interaction measurement capability, which employs:-thin foils of Bismuth as photon conversion material;-thin foils of silicon-dioxide to absorb background electrons from low-energy scattered photons;-layered silicon sensors as active material, read out on both ends by pick-up strips with 1 mm pitch;-a readout consisting of a new generation of very-low noise and very fast electronics based on Si-Ge  Bipolar-Junction Transistor (BJT) components.The goal is to reach a time-of-flight measurement precision of 30 picoseconds or better, to maximize the spatial resolution along the line of flight of the two photons emitted by positron annihilation in matter, and a 3D detection granularity down to 1.0×1.2(RMS)×0.2 mm3, consequently improving the quality, the contrast and the uniformity of the image. This major breakthrough in time resolution will allow drastic reduction of backgrounds and therefore reduction of the dose of radioisotopes delivered to the patient. The high precision 3D reconstruction of the photon interaction point on the detector will also allow excellent photon tracking capability disregarding the emission angle.Another important feature is that such compact devices, assembled in rings, will allow more efficient combination of MRI and PET in clinically acclaimed hybrid scanners that are regarded as the next quantum leap in molecular imaging in medicine.This proposal is based on first prototype measurements and on specific simulations to show the full feasibility of the project. The composition of the proposed SINERGIA collaboration will allow detector physicists and specialized microelectronics engineers of the Geneva and Bern LHC communities to construct a working device and qualify it in existing test facilities. The Geneva HUG/ITMI and the Stanford/MIPS groups, that include bio-physicists with world-leading expertise in imaging techniques, will allow rapid and full control of the software for the reconstruction of structures, and the development of ad-hoc new filtering algorithms and data correction methods. This proposal deals with the R&D on the detectors, on the Si-Ge BJT ASIC and on the reconstruction software; its primary deliverable is the measurement of a phantom with a full ring of the detector (10cm in diameter), eventually immersed in an MRI scanner. To obtain an excellent time-resolution with long strips, keeping the number of readout channels small, it is proposed to match the impedance of the electronics to the read-out strips of the silicon detectors. It should be noted that this method, already used for large area gaseous detectors but never for silicon, has many potential applications in medical, space and high-energy physics and represents an important R&D project by itself.If successful, continuation of the project for further three years is foreseen, which will envisage measurements with small animals and maybe human bodies with a larger detector.

Neuroprostheses are tools aimed at interacting with the human nervous system by means of electrodes used for stimulation (to induce neural activity as shown in Navarro, Krueger et al. 2005, Courtine, Gerasimenko et al. 2009, Hochberg, Bacher et al. 2012) or recording and decoding neural signals (to control robots, computers, or even paralyzed limbs as shown in Micera, Carpaneto et al. 2010, Ethier, Oby et al. 2012, Hochberg, Bacher et al. 2012)  The application of these concepts in the restoration of locomotion functions is nowadays getting closer to a real translation from the earliest animal experiments into a clinical tool to restore functions in human patients. In particular, epidural electrical stimulation (EES) that aims at the motor rehabilitation after spinal cord injury (SCI), or Parkinson's Disease (PD), is receiving a wide consensus in the scientific community (Fuentes, Petersson et al. 2009, Harkema, Gerasimenko et al. 2011, van den Brand, Heutschi et al. 2012, Gad, Choe et al. 2013)The majority of these techniques and related results are based on an inductive research approach in which optimization of the techniques is driven by several experiments in a trial-and-error basis. This situation is made even more challenging by the advancements of microtechnology which can provide more flexibility but also more parameters to select. Moreover, the neurophysiological processes under which it is possible to regain lost functions remain often unclear in particular for the techniques interacting with the central nervous system because of its intrinsic complexity. By investigating and understanding these basic problems (both from the technological and the neurophysiological viewpoints) it would be possible to boost the translation process and finally properly use these novel technological tools shifting the research approach from experiment-based induction to a deduction grounded on scientific hypotheses and theoretical models. This would allow: i) to increase the efficacy of these approaches for neurorehabilitation ii) to reduce the efforts to develop these solutions because of the current extensive trial-and-error approach and iii) to significantly reduce animal experiments necessary to achieve these goals. The proposers have applied this approach to develop neuroprostheses for the interaction with the peripheral nervous system (Raspopovic, Capogrosso et al. 2011, Raspopovic, Capogrosso et al. 2012) and the spinal cord (Capogrosso, Wenger et al. 2013) by developing computational models able to predict the behavior of neural interfaces in the static interaction with the nervous system. In particular, with these models we were able to uncover the neurophysiological principles which allow to regain motor functions after spinal cord injury by identifying the neural structures involved in the process (Capogrosso, Wenger et al., 2013), and also to correctly predict the shape and position of multi-electrode arrays that could enhance the specificity of the technique and thus its clinical relevance. In this project we will apply this approach to improve the efficacy of EES-based neuroprostheses for locomotion restoration after SCI. In particular, two main goals will be pursued: (1) to extend our established computational methods by modeling the dynamic interaction of spinal sensorimotor circuits and by connecting these networks with a biomechanical model of rat hindlimb and (2) to use the information gathered from the model to implement novel real-time control algorithms of spinal cord stimulation that make a direct use of this intrinsic modulation, thus enhancing the controllability, reliability, and stability of neuroprostheses based on EES to restore locomotion.","Neurophysiology and Brain Research","Biology and Medicine;Basic Medical Sciences","Laboratoire d'ingénierie neurale translationnelle EPFL - STI - CPN - TNE","Switzerland","EPF Lausanne - EPFL","Project funding (Div.

The origi-nal idea was to synchronize two eye trackers in order to deepen our understanding of on-line col-laborative problem solving. We have so far discovered that collaborative mechanisms are indeed linked with gaze patterns. In a nutshell, the degree of “coupling” of the collaborator’s gaze is linked with the efficiency of communication and the team problem solving performance. These results are very encouraging but we also realized that the link between gaze and interaction is more complex than we hypothesized. We propose herein to extend and deepen the research by addressing two challenges. First, the task dependency challenge aims to identify which level granularity in task decomposition we have to reach in order to be able to establish a mapping between gaze patterns and subtasks. Second, the interaction segmentation challenge stems from the need to identify spe-cific interaction episodes in order to be able to match them with gaze patterns. To address these challenges, we have to anchor the modelling of gaze patterns on more detailed task models and to develop new methods for a segmentation of the interactions into gaze-related episodes.","Psychology","Humanities and Social Sciences;Psychology, educational studies","Centre de Recherche et d'Appui pour la Formation et ses Technologies EPFL - CRAFT","Switzerland","EPF Lausanne - EPFL","Interdisciplinary projects",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"https://survey3.zsi.at/index.php/admin/responses/sa/view/surveyid/718586/id/238",2021-10-07 11:16:47,9,"en",2067113741,"HX7daRCAamLj0Se",2021-10-07 11:11:52,2021-10-07 11:16:47,"128.179.177.95",NA,"9","60ies","e",8,"Y","NA","8",9,9,3,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"useful invention",2,"0","0","0","1","0","1","cocr",NA,NA,NA,"cons",NA,"cons","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA",1,1,"0","0","0","N","Y","6","1","1","6","1","3","9","und",NA,NA,"und",NA,"und","und",NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,"7",1,7,9,1,"NA","1","NA","NA","NA","1","NA","NA","NA","NA","1","10","7","9",0,NA,NA,NA

In particular, insurance companies have come under scrutiny to increase their solvency capital and restrict their asset allocation to meet new regulatory requirements, such as Solvency II and the Swiss Solvency Test. Moreover, the low-interest rate environment strains the asset side of insurers’ balance sheets, as asset managers have difficulties in finding good risk-return investments to match their long duration liabilities. On the other hand, a sudden rise in interest rates might result in an increase in the lapse ratio, which gives birth to liquidity risk.Furthermore, demographic changes have shifted pension system in many countries from a defined benefit to a defined contribution system, which means that individual customers have to play a more active role in the provision of old age income. Pension scheme's participants have experienced reductions in their retirement benefits as consequence of higher life expectancy and low rates of return. Therefore, insurers have responded by offering life insurance products in the form of non-compulsory pension plans aimed at improving customers’ old age income. Old age provision products such as participating (endowment) and unit-linked life insurance are offered with a variety of options and guarantees to the clients. These options are in turn difficult to price, often costly to the policyholders, as risk management activities need to be carried out of the insurer’s provision. The following research proposal aims to address some of the challenges currently faced by the life insurance industry while shifting the focus from the perspective of the insurer to those of the policyholders and regulators. Therefore, in research project one (1) we value the premium payment options in an environment where the interest rates are stochastic and analyze how the costs of such options could impact the supply and demand for participating life insurance products. In this context, we aim to find the best feasible strategy for the policy¬holder to use the embedded premium payment options of the contract. In research project two (2), we look at how liquidity risk can be modeled and managed to prevent adverse consequences in the life insurance market (and hence for the policyholders). In research paper three (3), we derive fair prices for individual pension schemes and investigate the conditions under which a policyholder might want to join a particular pension plan.  Lastly, papers four and five focuses on the topic of interest rate (investment) guarantees, which are present in various old age provision products. In particular, we are interested in analyzing whether the utility that customers derive from purchasing such products and their willingness to pay are sufficient to explain their demand. In paper four we look at various product attributes such as the length of the investment horizon and the level of guarantee and the customer’s willingness to pay for such features, whereas in paper five we look at the way in which the characteristics of the customers affect their decision to purchase interest rate guarantees. Through this comprehensive research project, we aim to address some of the questions that are currently of relevance for academics in the field of risk and insurance. We also hope to transcend the boundaries of aca¬demia and make a lasting societal impact due to the ample economic implications of the project and the current need for pension reform both in Switzerland and internationally.","Science of management","Humanities and Social Sciences;Economics, law","Institut für Versicherungswirtschaft Universität St. Gallen","Switzerland","University of St.Gallen - SG","Project funding (Div.

Ce déplacement dans le débat, avec en arrière-fond le débat opposant technicité et vocation, s’est opéré par l’intermédiaire de la diffusion du modèle du praticien réflexif de Schön et ses dérivés comme principale figure de professionnalité, dans le cadre de la logique de l’alternance elle-même concomitante à la notion de compétence. Deux problèmes se posent alors du point de vue de la construction de la professionnalité. Premièrement, que deviennent les valeurs si on les considère dans une logique de compétence? Est-ce à dire que les valeurs n’ont plus leur place ou leur mot à dire dans la professionnalisation des travailleurs sociaux ? Cela s’avère peu probable, sauf à nier tout un pan de la réalité des pratiques. Deuxièmement, le modèle du praticien réflexif, même s’il a pour ambition de développer une épistémologie de la pratique non applicationniste, loge néanmoins l’expertise dans un processus intellectuel privé, ce qui a deux conséquences insatisfaisantes. D’une part, en définissant la professionnalité comme un phénomène privé depuis les dispositions personnelles des professionnels, il fait encourir le risque à la professionnalité d’être définie négativement en cas d’échec ou d’impuissance en plaçant sur les épaules des professionnels la responsabilité de l’action. Et d’autre part, cette conception de la professionnalité n’intègre pas les récents travaux de la cognition distribuée sur les rapports à l’environnement. Notre dernière recherche consacrée à la réflexivité dans l’activité d’éducateurs spécialisés depuis un cadre théorique prenant appui sur la sociologie de l’action de Quéré et Ogien ainsi que sur la philosophie pragmatiste deweyenne, souligne justement que la réflexivité des professionnels ne s’avère pas suffisante pour décrire la construction des problèmes pratiques dans l’action. Nous avons alors exploré un cadre théorique permettant de proposer pour la professionnalité une définition alternative au modèle du praticien réflexif et qui, en optant pour une définition publique, située et dynamique de la professionnalité à partir de la notion d’enquête pratique, permet d’éviter l’écueil de sa définition négative et sa conception intellectualiste. Nous avons dans cette recherche notamment pu mesurer combien les enquêtes pratiques des professionnels sont alimentées par d’incessantes attributions de qualités aux objets de l’environnement. Forts de ce constat, nous souhaitons aujourd’hui problématiser la construction de la professionnalité en mettant l’accent sur l’intégration des valeurs. Nous examinerons la place qu’y occupe leur formation, en considérant les valeurs comme faisant partie intégrante de l’activité. Nous associons ainsi valeurs et expertise dans l’étude de la construction de la professionnalité, en les définissant à la suite de Dewey non pas seulement comme des contenus idéaux déjà tout constitués mais également comme un processus d’enquête permettant d’aboutir à des jugements pratiques et relevant de conduites sociales observables. Nos données secondaires sont issues de notre recherche antérieure consacrée à la réflexivité, menée sur un terrain de l’éducation spécialisée dans un foyer accueillant des adolescents en rupture familiale et/ou sociale. Ce terrain est caractérisé par un changement de prescription impliquant une injonction de mise en place, à côté de l’actuelle mission d’accompagnement psycho-social en internat, d’une nouvelle mission se concrétisant par un centre de jour proposant des ateliers d’insertion. Ce changement bouleversant les habitudes et les valeurs, ce terrain nous paraît particulièrement propice. Il s’agit ainsi d’observer comment un tel contexte de changement de prescriptions est l’occasion d’une construction de la professionnalité au sein de l’équipe depuis un processus de formation des valeurs intrinsèque à l’activité.

To be able to interfere with bacterial persistence it is vital to understand the molecular details of biofilm formation and to define how motile planktonic cells transit into surface-grown communities. The nucleotide second messenger cyclic di-guanosinemonophosphate (c-di-GMP) has emerged as a central regulatory factor governing bacterial surface adaptation and biofilm formation. Although c-di-GMP signaling may well represent the Achilles heel of bacterial communities, c-di-GMP networks in bacterial pathogens are exquisitely complex and an integrated cellular system to uncover the details of cdGMP dynamics is missing.To quantitatively describe cdGMP signaling we propose to exploit Caulobacter crescentus, an organism with a simple bimodal life-style that integrates the sessile-motile switch into its asymmetric division cycle. We aim to: 1) identify the role and regulation of all diguanylate cyclases and phosphodiesterases that contribute to the asymmetric cellular program with the goal to model the temporal and spatial distribution of cdGMP during development; 2) identify and characterize c-di-GMP effectors, their downstream targets and cellular pathways; 3) elucidate how c-di-GMP coordinates cell differentiation with cell growth and propagation; 4) unravel the role of c-di-GMP as an allosteric regulator in mechanosensation and in rapid adaptation of bacteria to growth on surfaces. We propose a multidisciplinary research program at the forefront of bacterial signal transduction that will provide the molecular and conceptual framework for a rapidly growing research field of second messenger signaling in pathogenic bacteria.","Experimental Microbiology","Biology and Medicine;Basic Biological Research","Biozentrum der Universität Basel Systembiologie","Switzerland","University of Basel - BS","Project funding (Div.

They strongly suggest that the production of protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), a fluorescent photosensitizer approved for cancer detection and photodynamic therapy (PDT), can be enhanced if the tissue is illuminated with sub-thermal near infrared light with specific spectral and radiometric conditions. In addition, we have recently demonstrated that the consumption of oxygen can be significantly increased in vivo when exposing the tissue at 808 nm. These observations open new research fields that will have important impacts for fundamental and applied sciences: enhancing and possibly homogenizing the PPIX production following administration of its precursors (aminolevulinic acid (ALA) or its derivatives) could increase its diagnostic and therapeutic applications and improve their performance. Additionally, studying the mechanisms of the PBM-induced PPIX’s endogenous production will provide useful information on the metabolic processes involved in PBM and cell respiration. These include oxygen delivery and consumption since PPIX, which is produced in the mitochondria, can be used as an oxygen sensor in vitro and in vivo, as recently demonstrated by our group.This project requires the use of dedicated time-resolved spectrometers (point and imaging) to assess the PPIX level and oxygen partial pressure (pO2) at cellular and tissular levels. We already developed an original 'point' optical fiber-based spectrometer to measure pO2 based on the change of PPIX’s delayed fluorescence lifetime. We plan to expand on this apparatus and develop an imaging system for microscopic and macroscopic (preclinical in vivo samples) observations. This imaging system will allow dynamic measurements of PPIX’s relative concentration and/or pO2 in various cellular or tissular compartments, which can provide information on the O2 transport mechanisms. Several magnifications and resolutions will be achieved by using suitable optics (fluorescence microscope or 'macro' lens). The imaging system will be dedicated to applications where spatial resolution of pO2 measurement is necessary. The point measurement system will be used when the molecular probe’s luminescence is too low to be imaged with an acceptable signal/noise ratio. Both systems will integrate a gateable detector to reject PPIX’s prompt fluorescence and measure the lifetime of its delayed fluorescence. It is crucial since PPIX’s total fluorescence is the sum of its (strong) prompt and (weaker by 2-3 orders of magnitude) delayed fluorescence, yet only the latter has an oxygen-dependent decay time. Finally, another imaging system (SpectraCube®) available in our laboratory will be updated to perform spectral measurements of fluorophores in vivo, allowing us to: 1) study the spectral distortions due to the possible modification of the relative luminescence contributions of the various porphyrins involved in the PPIX biosynthesis; 2) assess the level of PPIX photobleaching during pO2 measurements through the luminescence of its photoproducts. Since PPIX can induce photodamage during pO2 measurements, we will at times use other probes with either very high pO2 sensitivity (Pd-meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (PdTCPP)) or very low phototoxicity ((1,10-phenanthroline) ruthenium (II) hydrate (Ru(Phen)32+)), two probes we have extensively investigated in vivo and in vitro.PBM will be studied with our chick’s chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model, and with epidermal equivalent tissue samples. These two different models complement each other: the former allows the study of vascular effects of PBM in vivo, including changes of pO2, and the study of photosensitizers used for PDT on tumor xenografts and normal tissues; the latter is more suited to study the effects of PBM at cellular or tissular levels.Consequently, the two main objectives of this project are:A) To study the synergy or combined effects of PPIX-induced PDT and PBM on the vasculature of the CAM model and with epidermal equivalent tissue samples following two strategies: I) Studying the increased production of PPIX induced by PBM or II) Exploring interactive mechanistic effects induced at molecular or cellular level (production of reactive oxygen species (ROS); oxygen consumption; mitochondrial/cell respiration). Since both PDT and PBM are highly sensitive to the levels of nitric oxide (NO) or carbon monoxide (CO), the modulation of the effects mentioned in I) and II) will be studied following the administration of these two gases.B) To study the modulation of tissue oxygenation induced by PBM. This will be measured in vivo and in vitro with pO2 probes (PPIX, PdTCPP and Ru(Phen)32+) depending on the pO2 and on the tissue compartment. Images of pO2 will provide information about the tissular and cellular compartments where the PBM effects take place. Using PPIX for this sub-project is of high interest since it is produced and transformed in the mitochondria, a pivotal site in cell respiration. In addition to providing mechanistic information on the modification of cell respiration by PBM, this sub-project will allow the systematic in vitro and in vivo exploration of numerous radiometric and spectral PBM parameters. This is difficult to conduct using standard techniques (Seahorse; MitoTracker; etc.), whereas the experimental approach we propose studies the effects of PBM almost in real time. Measuring action spectra of PBM in vivo with precise control over radiometry and spectroscopy at different wavelengths and in different tissue compartments, a key competence of our group, is truly novel to the best of our knowledge.The sub-projects A) will be conducted by a PhD student and B) by a Postdoc because sub-project A) is less risky than B).In conclusion, the main contributions of this project will be to study in vivo the PBM-induced modulation of: 1) endogenous production of PPIX, a biomolecule produced in the mitochondria; 2) pO2 in blood vessels and other tissue compartments; 3) PDT with precisely controlled radiometric and spectral conditions and using imaging systems. Inducing this modulation with different wavelengths, combined or not, will provide information of fundamental interest about the light absorbers involved in PBM.","Biophysics","Biology and Medicine;Basic Biological Research","Laboratoire de chimie organométallique et médicinale EPFL - SB - ISIC - LCOM","Switzerland","EPF Lausanne - EPFL","Interdisciplinary projects",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Peer-reviewed","Original article (peer-reviewed)","Red and NIR light dosimetry in the human deep brain","Published","2015","","10.1088/0031-9155/60/7/2921","http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0031-9155/60/7/2921/meta","Physics in Medicine and Biology","Pitzschke A.,  Lovisa B.,  Lovisa B.,  Seydoux O.,  Zellweger M.,  Pfleiderer M.,  Tardy Y.,  Wagniéres G.","","Physics in Medicine and Biology","60","7","© 2015 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine. Photobiomodulation (PBM) appears promising to treat the hallmarks of Parkinson's Disease (PD) in cellular or animal models. We measured light propagation in different areas of PD relevant deep brain tissue during transcranial transsphenoidal illumination (at 671 and 808nm) of a cadaver head and modeled optical parameters of human brain tissue using Monte Carlo simulations. Gray matter white matter cerebrospinal fluid ventricles thalamus pons cerebellum and skull bone were processed into a mesh of the skull (158×201×211 voxels; voxel side length: 1mm). Optical parameters were optimized from simulated and measured fluence rate distributions. The estimated μefffor the different tissues was in all cases larger at 671 than at 808nm making latter a better choice for light delivery in the deep brain. Absolute values were comparable to those found in the literature or slightly smaller. The effective attenuation in the ventricles was considerably larger than literature values. Optimization yields a new set of optical parameters better reproducing the experimental data. A combination of PBM via the sphenoid sinus and oral cavity could be beneficial. A 20 fold higher efficiency of light delivery to the deep brain was achieved with ventricular instead of transcranial illumination. Our study demonstrates that it is possible to illuminate deep brain tissues transcranially transsphenoidally and via different application routes. This opens therapeutic options for sufferers of PD or other cerebral diseases necessitating light therapy.","Talks/events/exhibitions","Courses on: Biomedical Optics and Photomedicine","http://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/photomedicine-CH-448",2015,"https://survey3.zsi.at/index.php/admin/responses/sa/view/surveyid/718586/id/259",2021-10-07 19:04:09,9,"en",61582904,"ONSrzv6qIxphBR5",2021-10-07 18:52:20,2021-10-07 19:04:09,"178.197.221.213",NA,"9","50ies","e",5,"Y","NA","9",10,8,9,2,NA,NA,NA,"Y",NA,NA,2,"1","0","0","0","0","0","colla","colla",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1","1","NA","0","1",1,1,"0","1","0","N","Y","5","5","0","0","0","3","10","awar","awar",NA,NA,NA,"att","awar",NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,3,0,"0",1,10,9,1,"0","1","0","0","1","1","0","0","1","1","0","10","10","5",0,NA,NA,NA

Damit beschäftigt sich das Projekt mit einem Forschungsbereich, der bisher in der Schweiz nur wenig Beachtung fand, obwohl er von grosser Bedeutung für die heutige Wissensgesellschaft ist, in welcher soziale Ungleichheit ein Thema darstellt, das immer stärker ins öffentliche Interesse rückt. Geschichtliche Untersuchungen fehlen sogar ganz. Gerade diese können aber - indem sie auch den historischen Kontext angemessen berücksichtigen - sichtbar machen, inwiefern standes- sowie sozialpolitische Mobilitätserwartungen der Berufsverbände und staatlichen Akteure erfüllt werden, die mit institutionellen Ausdifferenzierungen im ausseruniversitären Hochschulbereich verbunden worden sind. Sie können zeigen, inwiefern die Fachhochschulen tatsächlich einen Beitrag zur Chancengleichheit leisten oder ob sich im Laufe der Jahrzehnte lediglich die ungleiche Chancenstruktur auf ein höheres Bildungsniveau verschoben hat. Damit verbunden ist die Frage, ob Fachhochschulen im Vergleich zu den universitären Hochschulen tatsächlich 'gleichwertig aber andersartig' sind oder eher 'gleichartig aber ungleichwertig', indem sich durch die Differenzierungsprozesse im Hochschulbereich auf der Ebene des älteren Elitebildungssystems (universitäre Hochschulen) ein Massenbildungssystem etablierte, welches letztendlich die 'Elitisierung' des Zugangs zu Bildung und Beschäftigung durch 'Cooling-out' als Ventilfunktion verstärkt, indem mit der Schaffung von Fachhochschulen Bildungswillige aus tieferen sozialen Schichten davon abgelenkt werden, ein Studium auf universitärem Hochschulniveau zu ergreifen.Die Dissertation, an der bisher während zwei Jahren gearbeitet werden konnte, geht diesen Fragen in der Analyse der ausseruniversitären Hochschulentwicklung im Bereich Wirtschaft in der Schweiz nach. Dabei sollen Ursachen und Mechanismen sichtbar gemacht werden, welche die Chancengleichheit und damit die soziale Mobilität fördern oder zur Reproduktion der Sozialstruktur beitragen. Ein besonderes Augenmerk soll hierbei geschlechtsspezifischen Aspekten zukommen. Das vorliegende Gesuch betrifft die Finanzierung der abschliessenden zwei Jahre.Der theoretische Schwerpunkt liegt auf zwei zentralen Konzepten der Soziologie Pierre Bourdieus: dem Feld- und dem Habituskonzept. Während das Habituskonzept bei den Akteuren ansetzt und deren Dispositionen erklärt, bezieht sich das Feldkonzept auf die sozialen Strukturen und soll die Positionierung von Akteuren und Akteursgruppen im sozialen Raum erklären. Als Scharnier zwischen den beiden Seiten sozialer Realität - Feldern und Habitus - fungieren die Kapitalien (ökonomisches, kulturelles, soziales und symbolisches Kapital). Zur Analyse wird der Untersuchungszeitraum in drei Entwicklungsphasen der HWV resp. Hochschulen für Wirtschaft aufgeteilt. Für jede dieser drei Entwicklungsphasen werden folgende drei Untersuchungsschritte vorgenommen: Zunächst werden die hier bedeutsamen historischen Prozesse beschrieben. Sodann werden im Subfeld der kaufmännisch-betriebswirtschaftlichen Bildung die feldspezifischen Spielregeln sowie die massgebenden Akteursgruppen mit ihren spezifischen Kapitalien und Interessen in Bezug auf die jeweilige Entwicklungsphase der HWV resp. Hochschulen für Wirtschaft analysiert. In einem dritten Schritt wird der Habitus von Absolventinnen und Absolventen der HWV resp. Hochschule für Wirtschaft beschrieben. Danach werden die Ergebnisse der drei Entwicklungsphasen zusammengeführt und Wandel sowie Konstanz über die Jahrzehnte aufgezeigt.Da bezüglich sozialer Mobilität die 'klassischen' Quellen dünn gesät sind, werden diese durch forschungsproduzierte Quellen ergänzt. Dazu wurde bereits eine halbstrukturierte schriftliche Befragung (online und postalisch) bei zwei der ältesten Gesellschaften von Absolventen der HWV und Hochschule für Wirtschaft durchgeführt. Zudem wurden 4 Experteninterviews durchgeführt. Noch ausstehend sind 4 Experteninterviews sowie 12 lebensgeschichtliche Interviews, die mit Absolventen und Absolventinnen geführt werden, welche bereits an der schriftlichen Befragung teilgenommen haben. Die Erschliessung des komplexen Datenmaterials erfordert einen Methodenmix.

The project is divided into two subprojects, one examining the legal aspects of the recent phenomenon of fast-growing garbage patches in the oceans, the other studying marine genetic resources in areas beyond national jurisdiction from a legal point of view. Due to their topicality and their large impacts not only on marine ecosystems and the environment, but also on international trade, research, human health and our everyday life, both topics are of an increasing interest to the scientific community, policy-makers and the public at large. The project forms part of a larger research agenda exploring the legal principle of common concern in international law.The first subproject (A) comprises the analysis of different legal aspects of marine plastic pollution, including jurisdictional issues as well as issues of potential liability and responsibility under international law. The main focus of the project will be on options that can be provided by different instruments of international and regional law in order to address the problem. The project investigates the potentials of public international and regional law to remedy the current situation and prevent further pollution. It aims at suggesting a set of practicable, efficient and effective solutions. In order to picture the legal aspects of the relatively new phenomenon of garbage patches in a comprehensive way, the project takes into account all relevant fields of law, including the law of the sea, international environmental law and trade law. It includes an impact assessment of large-scale plastic accumulation in the oceans, especially with regard to the environment and human health, and considers the role of different players such as states, international institutions and the private sector. The set of options will include concrete strategies in the fields of international governance and trade law and should be of high practical value.The second subproject (B) examines the three main aspects of the current legal regime regarding marine genetic resources other than fish and mammals, i.e. the law of the sea, the law of biodiversity and intellectual property rights law. Subproject (B) identifies possible gaps and suggests appropriate solutions. The project contains an outline of the international debate on the topic, main concerns and arguments raised, and will propose a set of tools that might help to tackle the issues at stake. In particular, the project will consider the validity of moving towards a future regime inspired by the FAO International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA) as a model upon which a regime for marine genetic resources could be designed.The two subprojects share a focus on common ocean spaces. They analyse two recent developments within and related to these spaces, as well as the legal concerns arising from these developments. In fact, the legal challenges as posed by these developments partially overlap. Both the large-scale accumulation of plastic litter in the oceans and the use of marine genetic resources in biotechnology are relatively new phenomena, almost unknown by the authors of the legal instruments dealing with, for instance, the law of the sea. The relevant legal frameworks are therefore not per se designed to deal with these issues. It is the aim of this project to identify gaps and suggest a way forward.Due to their close relation to areas beyond national jurisdiction, the two phenomena constitute common concerns: On the one hand, the plastic garbage patches as a global public damage and nuisance are caused by, and within, different countries, whether through state or private actors. While the source of marine pollution (and of respective negative externalities) is under the realm of state jurisdiction, the primary impacts are not, or, at least, not exclusively, since the plastic garbage patches are mainly located in the high seas. The negative impacts, however, fall back on countries and individuals, although not necessarily on the polluters. In other words, the ones that hold the prime responsibility for the global damage are not the ones that suffer the consequences most. On the other hand, the high seas and the deep seabed provide resources, the use of which has high potentials for positive externalities, for instance in bioremediation or pharmaceutical applications with, say, anticancer effects. Due to the fact that only few countries have sufficient means and know-how to extract deep-seabed resources, others feel categorically excluded from actual or potential benefits arising from the use of those resources. Both subprojects therefore include issues of distributive justice and raise equity concerns. They moreover include collective action problems and issues of shared responsibility. The self-interest of the actors involved gradually leads to the depletion of marine environments - a situation strongly reminding us of Hardin’s theory of ‘The Tragedy of the Commons’ and problems of freeriding. The project will address these issues within each subproject and identify strategies to enhance international cooperation in the respective fields.Each of the two subprojects will be conducted by a doctoral student over a period of three years. The results will be published as independent dissertations in law. Publishing in peer-reviewed legal and interdisciplinary journals and participation in relevant conferences or other fora is also envisaged. The doctoral students will be supervised by the applicant and will benefit from the work at and the infrastructure of the Department of Economic Law at the University of Bern, the World Trade Institute, the NCCR Trade Regulation and other institutions that are part of the institute’s network. The applicant and the doctoral students will seek cooperation with institutions abroad working in the same fields, especially with the International Max Planck Research School for Maritime Affairs at the University of Heidelberg, Germany, the Fridtjof Nansen Institute in Lysaker, Norway, and the Law of the Sea Institute, Berkeley Law, at the University of California.","Legal sciences","Humanities and Social Sciences;Economics, law","Institut für Europa- und Wirtschaftsvölkerrecht Universität Bern","Switzerland","University of Berne - BE","Project funding (Div.

Recent research indicates that the welfare of the children was often secondary. Placement in a care home or a foster family was often associated with social isolation, compulsory work or even with sexual or physical abuse, with life-long consequences for those affected. Several European countries have recently undertaken efforts to reappraise this past and make reparations. Similar steps are currently in preparation in Switzerland. The proposed Sinergia project builds on this international debate. Its goal is to place biographical experiences in the context of the discourses, policies and practices of outplacement in Switzerland from 1950 to 1980. To illuminate the complexity and the changes that took place over time, various analytical approaches will be linked together. As the issues of foster children and of contract or indentured children (Verdingkinder) have been relatively well studied already, the subprojects here focus primarily on aspects of outplacement into care homes as well as the educational issues associated with the care provided in these homes. The Sinergia network is composed of three subprojects. Subproject 1 will investigate the contemporary discourse and debates about care home upbringing and adolescents (1942-1990). Subproject 2 will analyse the regional varieties in institutional assignment and placement practices (1940-1980). Subproject 3 will focus on the effects placement decisions had on the biographies of the affected care home “clients” (1950-1990). Unlike in previously published case studies, this project emphasizes synopsis and comparison. The project addresses multiple cases and examples, which differ by language region, religious denomination, and along the rural-urban divide. This allows for multidimensional analyses that reveal the variety of discourses, norms, actors and practices that guided behaviour. It also makes specific influences more visible. In asking about the connection between discourse and practice, as well as the effects of outplacement on individual biographies, the project does not focus exclusively on past injustices or the problems with administrative supervision. The goal is to understand the issues in a more comprehensive and analytically reflected way with respect to their diversity, context specificity, and trajectory. The emphasis of the subprojects lies on a period hitherto barely examined: 1940 to 1990. Placement in these post-war decades was subject to rapid structural change - as was Swiss society more generally. The care home campaign (Heimkampagne) of 1970 and the revision of the child laws (Kindsrecht) in 1978 were decisive turning points. A further goal of the project is to investigate the causes and forms these shifts took. The project is interdisciplinary in nature (contemporary history, social work) and combines methodological approaches from the historical sciences (subprojects 1 and 2) with those from the social sciences (subprojects 1 and 3).","Swiss history","Humanities and Social Sciences;Theology & religious studies, history, classical studies, archaeology, prehistory and early history","Institut Integration und Partizipation Hochschule für Soziale Arbeit Fachhochschule Nordwestschweiz","Switzerland","University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland (without UTE) - FHNW","Sinergia","in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results","Australia","01.11.2013","28.02.2018",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Other activities","Zum Verschwinden und Entwerten der Persönlichkeit; Stellungnahme Forschungserkenntnisse fürsorgerisc","www.newsd.admin.ch/newsd/message/attachments/51032.pdf",2018,"https://survey3.zsi.at/index.php/admin/responses/sa/view/surveyid/718586/id/289",2021-10-11 13:36:04,9,"en",2005100923,"jAIbKac0iM0mjXs",2021-10-11 12:45:05,2021-10-11 13:36:04,"79.9.100.205",NA,"8","60ies","e",7,"Y","NA","8",10,5,8,2,"Y",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,"0","1","1","2","1","1","cocr",NA,"contr","cons","contr","cons","contr","0","1","0","1","1",1,0,"0","0","1","Y","Y","8","2","9","10","7","7","10","awar",NA,"att","att","awar","awar","und",NA,8,NA,"Y",NA,NA,7,9,"10",99,10,10,1,"1","1","0","0","1","1","0","1","0","1","1","99","8","9",1,"The interdisciplinarity of the reserach network located at five universities in the german and frensh speaking part of Switzerland was very inspiring.

Am Beispiel von sieben Schweizer Städten","Sacred topography; Modern city; History of sacred buildings; Church architecture; Religion; Urban development; Swiss cities","Das Forschungsprojekt untersucht die Transformationen städtischer Sakraltopographien von 1850 bis 2010 am Beispiel von sieben Schweizer Städten. Im Zuge der Erweiterung und Entwicklung der modernen Städte verändert sich auch deren Sakraltopographie, das heisst das Netz der religiösen Orte. Die christlichen Sakralbauten (Kirchen und Kapellen der verschiedenen Konfessionen und Gemeinschaften) prägen das Erscheinungsbild der modernen Städte zwar nicht mehr so stark wie das der vormodernen Städte, doch spielen sie in der Stadtplanung noch immer eine wichtige Rolle. Dazu kommen neu Sakralbauten auch nichtchristlicher Religionsgemeinschaften (Synagogen, Moscheen, Tempel), städtische Friedhöfe und in Institutionen wie Spitälern multireligiöse Gebetsräume (Räume der Stille), wobei letztere zunehmend religionsneutral gestaltet werden. Zu den Transformationen städtischer Sakraltopographien tragen sozialhistorische, politische, städtebauliche, religionsgeschichtliche, liturgische und andere Faktoren bei. Diese werden im Rahmen der Untersuchung im Hinblick auf den Ort der Sakralbauten und religiösen Versammlungsräume im städtischen Raum, deren Sichtbarkeit und deren architektonische Gestalt erforscht und diskutiert. Das Thema wird an sieben Fallbeispielen, den Schweizer Städten Basel, Bern, Fribourg, Genf, Lausanne, Luzern und Zürich untersucht. Der Vergleich mehrerer Städte erlaubt, Gemeinsamkeiten festzustellen und schärft gleichzeitig das Profil der einzelnen Städte. Die Arbeit am Forschungsprojekt umfasst drei Schritte. In einem ersten Schritt werden die relevanten Daten zu den religiösen Orten sowie zur Stadtentwicklung gesammelt. Im zweiten Schritt werden die Daten übereinandergelegt und die Profile der Sakraltopographien der einzelnen Städte erarbeitet. Im dritten Schritt werden die Sakraltopographien der sieben Städte miteinander verglichen. Die Arbeit geht von einem relationalen Raumbegriff aus. Sie lenkt die Aufmerksamkeit auf eine Räumlichkeit des Sakralen, die nicht nur religiös und kirchengeschichtlich bedingt ist, sondern auch sozial und kulturell, und deren Ausdrucksform nicht nur die einzelnen Sakralbauten sind, sondern alle religiösen Orte zusammen, in ihrer Beziehung untereinander und zum städtischen Raum. Als Ergebnis der Untersuchung werden Strukturen der Transformationen städtischer Sakraltopographien im 19. und 20. Jahrhundert erkennbar, woraus eine allgemeine Geschichte, allenfalls eine Theorie der Sakraltopographie der modernen Stadt resultieren. Der Aktualitätsbezug des Projekts ist durch die anhaltenden Transformationen der städtischen Sakraltopographien gegeben, erkennbar beispielsweise am Bemühen nichtchristlicher Glaubensgemeinschaften um mehr Sichtbarkeit im öffentlichen Raum oder an den Diskussionen um Kirchenumnutzungen. Für diese aktuellen Fragen liefert die Arbeit historisches Grundlagenwissen.","Religious studies, Theology","Humanities and Social Sciences;Theology & religious studies, history, classical studies, archaeology, prehistory and early history","Institut für Praktische Theologie Evangelisch-theologische Fakultät Universität Bern","Switzerland","University of Berne - BE","Project funding (Div.

Eine Ethnographie von Anerkennungsverhältnissen im Kindergarten","Schulethnographie; Anerkennung; doing difference; Integrative Schule; Kindergarten; Normalität; Subjektivierung; Heterogenität","„Die schwierige Praxis der integrativen Schule“. So titelt die Neue Zürcher Zeitung einen ihrer vielen Artikel über das in der Schweiz seit einigen Jahren praktizierte Schulmodell. Das hier präsentierte Forschungsprojekt nimmt sich dieser Praxis an und zielt auf fundierte Erkenntnisse zur Umsetzung der integrativen Idee auf der ersten Schulstufe. Schweizer Kindergärten beschulen seit der Einführung des Kindergarten-Obligatoriums und des integrativen Modells praktisch alle Kinder eines Schuljahrgangs. Der Umgang mit einer heterogenen Schülerschaft entwickelt sich entsprechend immer stärker zu einer Kernanforderung pädagogischen Handelns. Im Fokus des Forschungsvorhabens steht dieser pädagogische Umgang mit Heterogenität. Das Projekt erforscht vom ersten Kindergartentag an, wie Lehrpersonen anfangen, Kinder zu unterscheiden, und wie es dazu kommt, dass Kinder auffallen. Leitend ist dabei die Frage, wie und auf der Grundlage welcher Normen von Anerkennbarkeit Subjektpositionen von Kindern ausgehandelt werden. Dabei interessieren die impliziten und expliziten Kriterien der Unterscheidung sowie die schulischen Normalitätsvorstellungen der Lehrpersonen. Der Prozess der Identifikation ‚auffälliger Kinder’ sowie die Thematik der Anerkennung werden in den Blick genommen, weil beides von hoher Bedeutung für die schulische Sozialisation und Zugehörigkeit ist. Wissenschaftliche Erkenntnisse dazu ermöglichen es, die Auswirkungen der Anerkennungsverhandlungen auf das Wohlergehen der Kinder und auf die soziale (Differenz-)Ordnung der Schulklasse zu erhellen. Grundlagentheoretisch wird das Projekt in der Praxistheorie verortet, mit einem Fokus auf Prozesse des doing difference. Dieser Zugang wird mit anerkennungstheoretischen Überlegungen nach Judith Butler kombiniert. Anerkennung wird dabei nicht als moralische Anforderung an die pädagogische Praxis verstanden, sondern primär als Ausgangsbedingung für die Subjektivierung von Kindern als Schüler/innen. So können Anerkennungsprozesse machtkritisch analysiert werden. Um sie empirisch zugänglich zu machen, werden - wiederum praxistheoretisch gewendet - Praktiken der Adressierung in den Blick genommen. Das Projekt ist als eine (schul-)ethnographische Studie konzipiert, die mittels teilnehmender Beobachtung, problemzentrierten Interviews sowie Dokumentenanalysen vier Kindergärten im Kanton Zürich in den Blick nimmt. Diese werden nach sozioökonomischen Kriterien maximal kontrastierend ausgewählt, um unterschiedliche Aus-prägungen von Heterogenität einzubeziehen. Der Fokus liegt auf den Praktiken der Lehrpersonen. Die Überlegungen der Lehrpersonen zu ihrem alltäglichen Handlungsfeld sowie die Reaktionen der Kinder auf die Praktiken der Lehrpersonen werden dabei ebenso betrachtet wie die im Feld verwendeten Artefakte und Dokumente. Nebst den wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnissen zur Herstellung von Auffälligkeit und zu Anerkennungsverhältnissen im Kindergarten bietet das an der PH Zürich verankerte Projekt auch eine Reflexionsgrundlage für angehende und im Beruf stehende Lehrpersonen, insbesondere für die Reflexion von Vorstellungen zur ‚normalen Schülerin’ sowie für die Reflexion der eigenen Adressierungspraktiken.","Education and learning sciences, subject-specific education","Humanities and Social Sciences;Psychology, educational studies","Prorektorat Forschung und Entwicklung Pädagogische Hochschule Zürich","Switzerland","Pädagogische Hochschule Zürich - PHZH","Project funding (Div.

We will also show that educational ethnography in Germany and Switzerland despite the same language and a vivid exchange has unfolded differently.

The present project stems from the hypothesis that, although selection is intended to identify the most competent people and may elicit some positive outcomes, it might also have the paradoxical effect of reducing actual competence of its targets. This hypothesis is based on the notion that selection renders people’s competences negatively interdependent-the less competent people are selected out-thereby creating a struggle for competence. The importance of this phenomenon is that selection and the consequent struggle for competence may elicit a competence threat-the particularly aversive psychological feeling that self-competence is called into question-which is detrimental to performance, learning and cooperative social interactions. Six subprojects investigate, by conducting a series of experimental and correlational studies, the effects of the struggle for competence on competence threat at four different levels of analysis: ideological, intergroup, interpersonal and intra-individual. Project A will examine the societal roots of competence threat and study how the focus on meritocracy (ideological level) reflected by normative assessment (e.g. grades) can be used to operate a selection between members of privileged and underprivileged social categories (intergroup level). Project B studies how the selection function of educational systems (ideological level) focuses motivation on personal competence-threatening performance goals, which in turn reduce teachers’ quality of teaching as well as the performance of members of underprivileged social groups or categories (intergroup level). Project C studies social comparison between competent peers (interpersonal level) in terms of a threat to self-competence. Because being competent means being more competent compared to similar peers, a competent person may attempt to select out equally competent peers by hindering their performance as a way to affirming self-competence (intra-individual level). Project D applies this competence threat approach to peer reviewing, the prototype of the selection process in the promotion of science (ideological level). It is argued that peer reviewing is not only aimed at selecting good proposals, but also at showing competence, in particular through derogation of peers (interpersonal level) when their competence may constitute a threat to self-competence. Project E studies how societal norms and values predominantly oriented towards competition and selection (ideological level) may interfere with the implementation and effectiveness of one of the potentially most effective forms of social construction of knowledge, namely cooperative learning (interpersonal level), because of the salience of competence stakes. Project F studies how social comparison within the group is responsible for the competence threat that impairs performance (intra-individual level) of low achievers, but also how low achievers may benefit from a downward social comparison in an intergroup context with members of an outgroup of lower social status (intergroup level), as this new social comparison alleviates the competence threat. The present project studies the processes that lead from competence struggle to competence threat, but also the mechanisms that allow reversing these processes, which can provide insights as to specific and appropriate avenues for interventions and policy making. This team consists of six scholars who have worked for years on several projects that have set the ground for the present project. The Sinergia scheme would now allow moving from incremental to transformative research by making possible to articulate within the same project the four level of analysis necessary to fully understand the origin, mechanisms and consequences of competence threat. An end-goal of the present project will be to develop a multi-level theory of competence threat in the construction of knowledge.","Psychology","Humanities and Social Sciences;Psychology, educational studies","Institut des sciences sociales Faculté des sciences sociales et politiques Université de Lausanne","Switzerland","University of Lausanne - LA","Sinergia","in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results","Spain","01.01.2013","30.09.2016","Peer-reviewed","Original article (peer-reviewed)","The role of test anticipation in the link between performance-approach goals and academic achievement: A field experiment on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects.

A NeuroEconomic study of ADHD adults and healthy controls","decision-making; working memory training; attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); neuroeconomics; brain plasticity; EEG","A large number of studies demonstrate a strong correlation between general cognitive ability (i.e., general intelligence) and life success: Individuals with higher intelligence learn faster, are more productive, healthier, better leaders, and achieve better educational outcomes (Gottfredson, 1997, 2002; Gottfredson & Deary, 2004; Judge et al., 2004; Lord et al., 1986; Salgado et al., 2003; Schmidt & Hunter, 1998, 2004). At a more fundamental level, cognitive abilities are also strongly correlated with economic preferences. Individuals with better cognitive abilities are also more patient, more willing to take calculated risks, are more likely to obey norms of reciprocity, and more likely to hang on to odd jobs when the stakes are high (Dohmen et al, 2010, Burks et al., 2009; Frederick, 2005). Brain regions undergirding general intelligence include, among others, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and parietal region (Duncan et al. 1996; Jung & Haier, 2007; Kane & Engle, 2002). Intergral to having high intelligence is a well-functioning working memory (WM) (e.g, Oberauer et al., 2005) among other aspects of executive functions (EF). Recent studies show that rigorous working memory training (WMT) can have spillover effects on fluid intelligence in normal subjects (Jaeggi et al., 2008) and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients (Klingberg et al., 2005), including on attentional tasks and inhibitory tasks in children with ADHD symptoms (Klingberg et al., 2005). This finding opens the possibility of examining the causal role executive function on behavior and more importantly, on whether WM can be improved and if this improvement can lead to better decision-making in real-world outcomes (particulary for ADHD patients). At this time, there is a dearth of research that has investigated these effects. Moreover, the neurophysiological correlates of the fundamental processes that undergird decision-making tasks in these populations is not well known. In this project we will bring together a cross-functional team from psychiatry, neurosciences, and economics to address three open issues regarding the effect of WMT on decision-making in ADHD patients and healthy control, with important implications for all four research areas. We will investigate the impact of the effects of WMT on attention, inhibition, and economic decision-making in young adults with ADHD and healthy control subjects. Previous research has focused on the effects of WMT on children with ADHD, despite growing evidence that strong ADHD symptoms persist in adulthood. We administer a more rigorous and novel WMT to adult patients with ADHD. The results will provide an objective measure of the impact of WMT on transfer of this learning to other tasks by ADHD patients and controls, and help to understand the association, or the separability, between distinct cognitive abilities. At the same time, we will evaluate the effects of WMT on brain processes using EEG during specific task performance. We will quantify performance in EF before and after WMT and objectify its effects on brain function. The results will provide important data about brain plasticity after WMT and brain networks involved in specific EF tasks by patients and controls. It will enable us to interpret changes in behavior that may occur as a function of WMT. Finally, we will examine whether positive responders to the WMT by ADHD patients and controls have different outcomes in terms of academic adaptation. The combination of individuals with varying levels of intensity of ADHD will provide us with the possibility to examine positive responders to WMT and compare them to the less responsive to this cognitive training. Overall, the results of our study not only contribute to the theory of decision-making and neuroeconomics by providing new ways to test how EF affects choices. In the context of an original interdisciplinary collaboration the outcome of this project will include also important policy implications on the effectiveness of cognitive training for young adult ADHD patients, of which many still struggle with strong ADHD symptoms, opening a wide range of applications. It will also provide us with new evidence on the benefits of cognitive training for healthy adult subjects, contributing to the policy discussion on self-administered medication to boost attention in high-pressure work environments.","Economics","Humanities and Social Sciences;Economics, law","Département des systèmes d'information Faculté des Hautes Etudes Commerciales","Switzerland","University of Lausanne - LA","Interdisciplinary projects","in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results","United States of America","01.01.2012","30.06.2015","Peer-reviewed","Contribution to book (peer-reviewed)","Imperfect Decision Making and Risk Taking Are Affected by Personality","Published","2015","978-3-319-15143-4","10.1007/978-3-319-15144-1_6                                                                         ","https://serval.unil.ch/resource/serval:BIB_9E913627C9C1.P001/REF","Decision Making: Uncertainty, Imperfection, Deliberation and Scalability","Mesrobian Sarah K.,  Bader Michel,  Gotte Lorenz,  Villa Alessandro E.P.,  Lintas Alessandra","Springer Verlag,Switzerland","Decision Making: Uncertainty, Imperfection, Deliberation and Scalability","","","Classic game theory predicts that individuals should behave as rational agents in order to maximize their gain. In real life situations it is observed that human decision making does not follow this theory. Specific patterns of activity in several brain circuits identified in recent years have been associated with irrational and imperfect decision making. Brain activity modulated by dopamine and serotonin is assumed to be among the main drivers of the expression of personality traits and patients affected by Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are characterized by altered activity in those neuromodulating circuits. We investigated the effect of fairness and personality traits on neuronal and psychological mechanisms of decision making and risk taking in two sets of experiments based on the Ultimatum Game (UG) and the Investment Game (IG). In the UG we found that Fairness and Conscientiousness were associated with responder’s gain and with event related potentials (ERP) components Feedback Related Negativity (FRN) and Late Positive component (LPP). In the IG the sum gained during the risky gambling task were presented immediately after half of the trials (condition “high frequency feedback” HFFB) while the other half were presented at the end of each block (condition “low frequency feedback” LFFB).

The contingent negative variation (CNV) component was affected in a different way in controls and participants with ADHD as a function of the feedback frequency (HFFB  versus  LFFB).

Infrastructure investments, the reform of financial regulation or the reduction of CO2 emissions are familiar examples. In other areas, policy activities may be above or below socially desirable levels. Prominent examples are excessive public debt levels or lax bank capital requirements. The multiple causes of these drawbacks of democracy are well-known. Until recently, these deficiencies of democratic decision-making were considered to be uncorrectable. Yet, in the past few years, several researchers have started to examine alternative, socially more beneficial ways to reach collective decisions. In this project, we want to take a further, important step on this road. Our core idea is to develop novel blueprints for democratic decision-making, without interfering with the fundamental values of liberal democracy. Those blueprints are expected to be operational at two different levels of democracy:1. New political contracts- Re-election threshold contracts- Coalition contracts2. New voting rules- Voting-twice- Higher re-election hurdles for incumbentsWe will draw on a variety of methods from economics, political economics and constitutional law to develop these new models and the corresponding model languages. With these, we will explore whether and how these novel rules can mitigate the deficiencies of democratic decision-making and eventually create new blueprints for democracy. We will examine how robust these blueprints are, and whether our ideas might have unintended consequences. We will then outline procedural rules for the implementation of our suggestions. While we focus on scientific publications, our results will also be communicated in a non-technical manner to decision-makers and to the general public to stimulate rule implementation.","Economics","Humanities and Social Sciences;Economics, law","Makroökonomie, Innovation und Politik MTEC ETH Zürich","Switzerland","ETH Zurich - ETHZ","Project funding (Div.

Taking an historical approach, the research includes, on the one hand, an examination of the development that has taken place in the organisation of campaigning in particular with regard to the internal discussions, negotiations and decision-making that political parties undertake when preparing, designing and leading election campaigns. On the other hand, the project analyses communication patterns and discourses that political parties adopt in order to address the public in election campaigns and which they use to cast the relevance and interpretation of particular political and social issues. The analysis of these two key areas in the study of campaigning is placed against the background of the specific cultural and institutional settings that have impregnated the history of post-war Switzerland.The proposed project examines and compares the four main political parties that have continuously played a key role in federal elections and government, namely the Liberal-Democratic Party (FDP), Christian-Democratic Party (CVP), Swiss People's Party (SVP) and Social-Democratic Party (SPS). The election campaigns in the seven federal election years of 1947, 1959, 1971, 1983, 1991, 1999 and 2007 are taken as case studies. Each election year represents a time when contextual factors and/or the transformation of the party system caused specific challenges to the four main parties. Taking account of the federal structure of the country’s political system, the project looks not only at the national level, but also at the cantonal level - namely the cantons of Zurich, Vaud and Ticino, which represent the largest cantons in each of the country’s three language regions. The main part of the corpus of sources and documents draws from party archives that are located in public archives and party offices, and which so far remain largely unexploited. An initial investigation of all sixteen party archives (four at the national level and twelve within the three cantons) has revealed the richness of these holdings and allows a comprehensive examination of the parties’ organisational and preparatory campaign work, as well as their election campaigns. Further sources include documents (ads, announcements, interviews, etc) dealing with matters relating to elections that have been published in newspapers during the period of the election campaign. For the elections that took place in the 2000s, the research also considers electronic sources, such as party websites and other election material. The collected sources and documents will be evaluated and analysed in order to hermeneutically reconstruct the discourses and practices that political parties adopt in election campaigns.An important objective of the project is to support the recent revitalisation of historical Swiss party research and contribute to it catching up with its Anglo-Saxon, German and French counterparts, where in the field of political history has been considerably renewed in recent years. The organisation of an international conference at the end of the research will give the opportunity to bring together leading scholars in the study of party campaigning and to present the results of the research. Moreover, the research project integrates two PhD studies and therefore contributes to the advancement of young academic careers. Since questions of party politics and election campaigns have, in recent years, excited more interest in Switzerland, the proposed research project also seeks to achieve the wide diffusion of its findings, and to reach out not only to the scientific community, but also to the general public.","Swiss history","Humanities and Social Sciences;Theology & religious studies, history, classical studies, archaeology, prehistory and early history","Seminar für Zeitgeschichte Universität Freiburg","Switzerland","University of Fribourg - FR","Project funding (Div.

Recent technological / analytical advances make possible the analysis of numerous spectacular phenotypes in new model species. In the last 2.5 years, we successfully (i) established new mammalian and reptilian model species in our laboratory; (ii) investigated the evolution of genome content in chordates; (iii) analysed transcriptomes of 5 divergent reptilian lineages; and (iv) studied the corn-snake vomeronasal organ (VNO) transcriptome. This research led to the publication of 6 articles in peer-reviewed international journals, 1 book chapter, and 1 manuscript soon to be submitted for publication. In addition, we (v) accumulated very significant results on the genetic basis of the convergent development of spines in spiny mice, hedgehogs, and tenrecs and (vi) started the analysis of the genetic determinism of scales in reptiles. The two latter studies (on spines and scales) are very related conceptually (they both involve reaction-diffusion mechanisms of skin appendage patterning) and in terms of required laboratory techniques (deep sequencing, microarray analyses, in situ hybridisation, immuno-histochemistry, ex-vivo skin cultures). Here, we propose to exploit the results of the last 2.5 years for (a) developing the version 2 of the ‘Reptilian Transcriptome’ by performing RNA sequencing with much improved coverage, depth, and assembly; (b) extending our evolutionary analyses of reptile VNO receptors repertoires to turtles as well as aquatic, arboreal, and burrowing snakes; and (c) extending our understanding of the evolutionary developmental mechanisms generating skin appendage novelties in amniotes, namely spines in mammals, and scales in reptiles. More specifically, we propose to generate much additional transcriptome sequence data in (i) the Nile crocodile, (ii) the Corn snake, (iii) the Bearded dragon, and (iv) the red-eared turtle for building true Phylomes. We will generate multiple alignments and phylogenetic trees among all protein sequences within each gene family, and integrate all gene trees (including ENSEMBL genes from other amniote species) into MANTiS, a software which will then allow easy investigation of genome content evolution and associated molecular functions across amniotes in general and among reptiles in particular. Very large numbers of SSR loci and SNPs will be identified for future quantitative and population genetic analyses. Finally, a massive dataset of several million aa for each species will be analysed under Grid and Cloud versions of MetaPIGA for generating what could become one of the best supported phylogeny of vertebrates. Second, we suggest performing extended VNO transcriptome sequencing and analysis in 2 turtles, 1 monitor lizard, and 3 snake species to identify whether changes in VNO repertoires have evolved by adaptations to different habitats and life styles, and shifts in the significance of sensory inputs, or through the development of tongue flicking. Finally, we will complete our analyses of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of morphological novelties associated with the skin epidermis, namely spines in mammals and scales in reptiles. In the spine project, we will build up on our significantly advanced results. More specifically, we will (i) confirm the molecular mechanisms involved in the evolutionary transformation of hairs into spines by validating our microarray analyses with Nanostring technology, ex-vivo skin cultures, as well as in-vivo perturbation of the corresponding signalling pathways in the developing embryo, (ii) model mathematically the induction dynamics of spine development in each of the three species on reconstructed 3D geometry and high-resolution texture, (iii) perform quantitative proteomic analyses (with iTRAQ labelling) for the fine characterisation of hair and spine protein content, and (iv) evaluate the possibility to extend our analyses to other spiny mammals (porcupines and echidnas). In the scale project, we will use wild-type and spectacular scaleless mutants in the bearded dragon, the corn snake, and the Texas rat snake for analysing (i) the morphogenesis of the integumentary system in developing squamate reptiles using histology/immuno-histochemistry methods and mathematical simulations, and (ii) the molecular mechanisms of reptile-specific scale development using in situ hybridisation, deep sequencing, Nanostring technology, and ex-vivo skin cultures.","Zoology","Biology and Medicine;General Biology","Département de Génétique et Evolution Faculté des Sciences Université de Genève","Switzerland","University of Geneva - GE","Project funding (Div.

Genauer wird gefragt, ob die Philosophie gesellschaftliche Entwicklungen mit Begru¨ndungen unterstu¨tzen oder kritisieren soll, oder ob Kritik und Unterstu¨tzung angemessener in Erzählungen - ku¨nstlerischen Werken, journalistischen Appellen, historischen Berichten, usw. - erfolgen sollte. In der neopragmatistischen Philosophie hat sich Richard Rorty vehement fu¨r den narrativen Ansatz ausgesprochen und ihm eine charakteristische Form verliehen; und Hilary Putnam hat dezidiert fu¨r das bedeutungstheoretische Unternehmen argumentiert. Bei beiden sind Überlegungen von John Dewey einflussreich gewesen.Im Anschluss an Rorty soll gezeigt werden, wieso ein Verzicht auf  egru¨ndungen unter bestimmten Umständen sinnvoll sein kann. Das kreative Potential von Erzählungen und artistischen Produkten ermöglicht es, uns in unserem Selbstverständnis als Individuen und als Mitglieder von Gemeinschaften nachhaltiger zu prägen als theoretische Räsonnements. Indes hat Rorty in der Folge seiner Kontingenz- und Ethnozentrismusphilosophie unnötigerweise jede Art von wissenschaftlicher Tätigkeit als kulturtragend bekämpft, sofern sie um die Erzeugung von normativen Deutungsmodellen bemu¨ht ist. Dies liegt nicht im narrativen Ansatz selbst, sondern ist eine Folge der Verbindung dieses Ansatzes mit seinem Ironiebegriff. Dieser Begriff und jene Verbindung werden einer Kritikunterzogen.Andererseits - und gegen Rorty - wird mit Putnam die These vertreten, dass die Philosophie gesellschaftliche Entwicklungen in Theorien bewerten soll. Putnam sieht die Aufgabe der Philosophie darin, einen Mittelweg zwischen Fallibilismus und Skeptizismus zu finden. Als Beispiel wird Putnams Versuch diskutiert, die Demokratie philosophisch zu verteidigen. Dieser Versuch arbeitet mit der an Deweys Konzept der inquiry orientierten Idee, dass sich die Erhöhung der sachlichen Rationalität aus der Inklusion möglichst verschiedener Perspektiven sowie aus einer Verringerung der Akzeptanzschwelle fu¨r diese Sache ergeben soll. Die Idee wird allerdings insofern negativ bewertet, als sie - anders als Dewey - Demokratie auf eine Form der prozeduralen Demokratie als breit anwendbare Methode der politischen Entscheidungsfindung reduziert.Es soll eine neue Deweyinterpretation vorgeschlagen werden, die einen engen Zusammenhang herstellt zwischen Deweys Begriff „experience“, seinem ethischen Ideal der Demokratie als Lebensform und seinem u¨ber dieWissenschaften hinaus anwendbaren Ideal der „inquiry“. Mit dieser Begriffskonstellation bei Dewey kann versucht werden, den begru¨ndungstheoretischen Ansatz von Putnam mit dem narrativen Ansatz von Rorty in einer pragmatistischen Perspektive zu vereinen.","Philosophy","Humanities and Social Sciences;Linguistics and literature, philosophy","Professur für Philosophie GESS/Institut für Philosophie ETH Zürich","Switzerland","ETH Zurich - ETHZ","Project funding (Div.

This article argues in favor of this Rortyan idea showing how anti foundationalism and solidarity can be seen as important instances of what I will call 'dispositions for democratic citizenship' and that art (and not only novels) and its reception are valuable tools for advancing these dispositions. However as the Rortyan public private dichotomy assigns art’s function of criticism only to the private sphere Rorty ignores its potential for stimulating democratic public deliberation and he misses the fact that art’s functions of criticism and of attentive empathetic perception partially depend on each other if they are effectively to lead to increased solidarity and change social realities.

In der Lehrerausbildung sollen die notwendigen Voraussetzungen für einen erfolgreichen Berufseinstieg und das selbständige Weiterlernen im Beruf geschaffen werden (Messner & Reusser, 2000; König & Blömeke, 2009). Damit verbunden ist eine dreifache Wirksamkeitserwartung: Erstens soll die Lehrerausbildung zum Aufbau professioneller Kompetenzen beitragen sowie Grundsteine für die Weiterentwicklung der Kompetenzen im Beruf legen. Zweitens sollen die erworbenen Kompetenzen in der Berufspraxis zu einer hohen Unterrichtsqualität führen, die schliesslich drittens erfolgreiche Lernprozesse anstossen und so einen positiven Effekt auf den Lernerfolg der Schülerinnen und Schüler bringen. Dabei bilden die professionellen Kompetenzen von Lehrpersonen das Scharnier zwischen Ausbildung und erfolgreichen Lehr-Lernprozessen. Die professionellen Kompetenzen entsprechen im Zusammenhang mit der Ausbildung den abhängigen Variablen, die aufgebaut und im Beruf weiterentwickelt werden sollen. Dabei dürfte der Berufseinstieg besser gelingen, wenn der Lernprozess im Beruf weiter geht und zu bewältigende Situationen als Lernanlässe betrachtet werden und so zu Kompetenzerweiterung führen können. In der Berufspraxis sind die professionellen Kompetenzen hingegen als Prädiktoren zu verstehen, die unterrichtliches Handeln und als Folge davon schulische Leistungen der Schülerinnen und Schüler vorhersagen. Erst die Verbindung dieser beiden Sichtweisen, unter Berücksichtigung individueller Eingangsbedingungen und Kontextfaktoren, ergibt ein umfassendes Bild der Wirksamkeit der Lehrerbildung.Die professionelle Kompetenz von Lehrkräften und ihr berufliches Handeln sind in den letzten Jahren - nicht zuletzt dank der vielbeachteten large-scale-Studien wie PISA, TIMSS oder IGLU, wodurch die Erklärungs-lücke zwischen System- und Kontextvariablen und Schülerleistungen offensichtlich wurde (Baumert, Blum & Neubrand, 2004) - vermehrt in den Blickpunkt des wissenschaftlichen, gesellschaftlichen und medialen Interesses gerückt. Dies hat zum einen Studien angeregt, die die Lehrerbildung und damit die Genese professioneller Kompetenzen ins Zentrum rücken (z.B. TEDS-LT, LEK, PaLea, OBSERVE), und zum anderen Projekte (z.B. COACTIV), die auf die Wirkungen professioneller Kompetenzen für schulische Lehr-Lernprozesse fokussieren. Trotz einigen bemerkenswerten Ergebnissen besteht nach wie vor ein Defizit bei der Erforschung von Aufbau und Wirkungen professioneller Lehrerkompetenzen. Insbesondere fehlen Unter-suchungen, die die beiden Perspektiven Genese und Effekte professioneller Kompetenz verbinden.Das geplante Projekt möchte zur Schliessung dieser Forschungslücke beitragen und die dreifache Wirksamkeitserwartung an die Lehrerausbildung empirisch überprüfen. Im Fokus stehen folglich (1) die Genese professioneller Kompetenzen in der Lehrerausbildung und die Weiterentwicklung in den ersten Berufsjahren, (2) die Wirkungen der professionellen Kompetenzen auf den (Mathematik-)Unterricht sowie (3) auf den Lernertrag der Schülerinnen und Schüler. Die ambitionierten Forschungsziele lassen sich mit den vergleichsweise bescheidenen Mitteln nur realisieren, weil das geplante Forschungsprojekt auf umfassende Vorarbeiten zurückgreifen kann. So schliesst die Studie konzeptionell und methodisch an die internationale Lehrerbildungsstudie TEDS-M an und führt den im Rahmen der schweizerischen TEDS-M Zusatzstudien begonnenen Längsschnitt bis ins dritte Berufsjahr weiter. Die Erhebungen im dritten Berufsjahr sehen indessen nicht nur die nochmalige Erfassung der professionellen Kompetenzen sowie des Wohlbefindens vor, sondern dienen auch dazu, Informationen zum unterrichtlichen Handeln zu gewinnen und die Lernerfolge der Schülerinnen und Schüler zu erfassen. Dadurch sollen die komplexen Beziehungen zwischen der Genese professioneller Kompetenzen und deren Wirkungen auf Unterricht und Schülerleistung erhellt und besser verstanden werden.Diese Erweiterung des ursprünglichen TEDS-M-Projekts zu einem echten Längsschnitt bis in die ersten Berufsjahre hat neben der erwähnten wissenschaftlichen Bedeutung auch bildungspolitische und praxisbezogene Relevanz. Insbesondere werden Hinweise für die Weiterentwicklung der Lehrerausbildung und von Weiterbildungsangeboten für Lehrpersonen, speziell in der wichtigen Phase des Berufseinstiegs, erwartet.","Education and learning sciences, subject-specific education","Humanities and Social Sciences;Psychology, educational studies","Institut Professionsforschung und Kompetenzentwicklung Pädagogische Hochschule St. Gallen","Switzerland","Pädagogische Hochschule St.Gallen - PHSG","Project funding (Div.

Once a city or urban quarter is built and problems in these areas start to arise, improvements can often only relieve the symptoms, and rarely address the roots. It is therefore important to address these issues appropriately and early in the planning process.Today's urban design goals often put energy efficiency in the foreground. But energy performance considerations alone do not make livable and sustainable urban environments. In addition to the eco-logical dimension, sustainable design must likewise consider the social dimension. However, this is often difficult to operationalize, especially in the planning phase, and is consequently not always sufficiently taken into account. In this context, an unsolved problem for sustainable urban planning is to interpret urban structures in terms of their social implications and to systematically evaluate urban design proposals in terms of their social and energy performance related aspects.In this project we will investigate the relationships between energy performance aspects of urban structures and the perception of a city by its inhabitants. In the first step, our project is focused on the assessment of social and energy performance data of exemplary urban structures in Zurich and Weimar. To this end, we develop methods to firstly measure the emotional impact of spatial struc-tures quantitatively based on empirical studies and secondly to extend the existing computer-based analytical methods to new aspects. For the energy analysis, we draw on existing methods. In the second step, we compare urban structures according to social and energy-related aspects by correlating the empirical data with the results of computer-based analyses. Based on the results of this comparison it is possible to interpret the calculated measures for urban structures in terms of social aspects such as user behavior and perception. In the third step, we draw on this to develop methods to find the best compromise solutions that fulfill social and energy performance aspects equally well. In our study we focus on two central fields of action in urban planning: the definition of street networks and the distribution of building masses, which are collectively referred to as urban morphology.The results of this project make it possible, using computer-based analysis methods and simple de-sign models, to forecast the social and energy performance implications of planning decisions, and to develop compromises for both dimensions. These planning aspects are crucial to ensure sustainable urban planning as urbanization increases.","Architecture and Social urban science","Humanities and Social Sciences;Art studies, musicology, theatre and film studies, architecture","Lehrstuhl für Informationsarchitektur Departement Architektur ETH Zürich","Switzerland","ETH Zurich - ETHZ","Project funding (Div.

Results are presented for subjective user  ratings as well as in relation to objective formal measures of spatial qualities via space syntax (e.g.  centrality measures integration and choice as well as isovist properties). A factor analysis of the  bipolar adjectives revealed that items were loaded on what we called appeal activity and spatial  experience of the streets. Previous experience in terms of spatial sequence did not appear to  influence these evaluations. The combination of global and local spatial properties correlates more  strongly with environmental appraisal or appeal of space than the use of either one of them.

In our previous research, we addressed a number of theoretical and practical problems of image identification using short robust fingerprinting codes and established important information-theoretic limits on the trade-off between  identification rate, complexity and memory. The main challenge of the preceding studies was to introduce theoretical foundations of reliable content identification and to develop a practical framework for the identification of physical objects based on their unique unclonable features. The developed algorithms have been tested experimentally on a specially created database, FAMOS, that contained multiple acquisitions of unique microstructure images originating from 5'000 packages that were acquired with special cameras in the controlled environment. These results have been published in several journal papers and presented at many reputable international conferences with acceptance rates below 30%. Additionally, we have submitted 2 patents, one of which has already been granted and received the distinction of the Latsis PhD award 2013 of the University of Geneva. This success and our new findings make it possible to extend the achieved results to other challenging applications related to physical object protection which recently emerged in the multimedia security and forensic community and the anti-counterfeiting industry.However, many previous results, identification algorithms and theoretical limits assumed that the quality of the acquired images is relatively high, which was a valid assumption for a controlled verification environment. In practice, many applications require physical object identification in the public domain, preferably using  mobile phones. This in turn creates additional constraints on the quality of the images, algorithmic complexity, memory, communication traffic and security. Additionally, the recent trends in identification technologies necessitate performing the identification in high-dimensional space, where methods developed for short codes and vector quantization face considerable difficulties. Finally, the anti-counterfeiting industry urgently seeks technologies capable of identifying objects not only based on their individual microstructures, but also according to their fine-grained visual design capable to distinguish even minor differences in appearance and  reliably authenticate the original object from its cloned counterparts. This creates a necessity to properly handle these new emerging security requirements and to reconsider the theoretical results derived for the assumptions for short codes and a high signal-to-noise ratio used in the previous fingerprinting techniques.It should be noted that the majority of existing identification techniques at most address the recognition of physical objects while fine-grained recognition is still considered major challenge. Furthermore, the distinguishability of fake objects and clones is largely non-addressed. Moreover, there is no public database of original products, their look-alike copies produced by re-design or copies produced by just scanning and printing as in the case of packages. Finally, the identification techniques dealing with such applications are largely unexplored and lack a thorough theoretical analysis. Thus, it is very important to identify, introduce and apply some common principles into the design, analysis and optimization of these identification techniques. In this context, the goal of the present proposal is to extend and further develop a new information-theoretic framework for physical object identification in the high-dimensional space of forensic features and apply it to practical systems. This goal will be achieved based on a novel interpretation of links between the  encoding techniques, machine learning and forensic identification  which will be theoretically introduced and explored in this project.As detailed in the proposal, the proposed theoretical framework of physical object identification relies on recent concepts and findings in information theory, high-dimensional embedding and sparse approximation, coding theory and machine learning.In the scope of this proposal, the following subjects will be investigated:(A) Information-theoretic analysis of physical object identification performance, complexity and memory storage;(B) Creation and enrollment of  databases of original and fake objects; (C) Practical implementation, optimization and validation.","Information Technology","Mathematics, Natural- and Engineering Sciences;Engineering Sciences","Centre Universitaire d'Informatique Université de Genève","Switzerland","University of Geneva - GE","Project funding (Div.

The spontaneous reactivation of recent memory traces may contribute to their consolidation. We hypothesize that this mechanism enhances the neural integration and representation of the most important information to optimize future behavior. The overarching aim of the project is to test this hypothesis by using a combination of advanced high-density EEG (hdEEG), functional MRI (fMRI) measurements, and neural decoding. This approach offers an unprecedented opportunity to study the spontaneous reemergence of patterns of neural activity corresponding to specific past experience across distinct vigilance states in humans.    A first main goal of the present project is to test whether information with a high relevance for future behavior is favored in the competition for reactivation. We and others recently showed that stimuli or behaviors with an affective relevance (e.g., aversively conditioned or rewarded information) reach improved memory representation at both the cognitive and neural levels after a period of sleep, suggesting that they undergo privileged offline reprocessing during sleep. However, to our knowledge, there is no direct evidence for such selectivity in spontaneous neural replay and its causal role in memory consolidation processes. In the present project, we propose to experimentally manipulate the affective relevance of a task and assess the reactivation of associated brain activity patterns by using neural decoding methods. Applied to activity and connectivity neuroimaging measures with a high spatial and temporal resolution (i.e., fMRI and hdEEG), this approach offers unique insights into the type of neural information that may be reactivated. A second main goal of the project is to decipher how neural reactivation operates across wakefulness and distinct stages of sleep, and how it affects the integration of new information into existing networks of representation. Ruminations and counter-factual thoughts are often reported at sleep onset, whereas the replay of rewarded memories may predominate during slow-wave sleep (SWS). Yet, these phenomena have never been investigated in the same experiment, their neural underpinnings remain unclear, and how they differentially contribute to memory processes is unsettled. We also expect to observe inter-individual differences since, for example, anxious individuals often report ruminations at sleep-onset, which may cause insomnia. A third goal of the project is to investigate another major indicator of experience-dependent local neural plasticity, namely synaptic homeostasis, which can be measured by slow-wave activity (SWA). Whether the emotional relevance of a learning task may also influence the spatial and temporal distribution of SWA during subsequent sleep is unknown. Importantly, while neural replay and synaptic homeostasis may both predominate during SWS, their possible cooperation and respective contributions to overnight brain changes need to be better understood.     This project proposal is designed to optimally address each of these goals. The methodological approach proposed is original, reliable, and timely. In particular, it exploits some recent developments in the domain of neural decoding that uniquely allow the study and interpretation of spontaneous brain activity. Moreover, based on concomitant measures of neural reactivation and local SWA, this project seeks to offer an integrative view on these distinct mechanisms of neural plasticity. Finally, by clarifying how emotionally-significant events are selected for offline memory reprocessing, our experimental proposal may provide new insights into the role of sleep (and lack of thereof) in the development, maintenance but also management of some affective disorders.     This work may have several important implications. At a theoretical level, by showing how distinct vigilance states contribute to the adaptive and ever-changing nature of memory representations. At a clinical level, by propounding that a healthy emotional balance involves a form of neural reverberation, which helps our brains learn from our daily failures and accomplishments.","Neurophysiology and Brain Research","Biology and Medicine;Basic Medical Sciences","Dépt des Neurosciences Fondamentales Faculté de Médecine Université de Genève","Switzerland","University of Geneva - GE","Project funding (Div.

Pris sous l’angle du handicap moteur, ce thème reste pourtant encore peu abordé ; les athlètes handicapés de haut-niveau occupent des places subalternes dans les mouvements sportifs et les medias nationaux et internationaux et souffrent de la comparaison avec les sportifs valides. Autrement dit, bien qu’ils incarnent l’idéal olympique d’amateurisme, de dépassement de soi, d’abnégation, de courage et d’expertise sportive, leurs performances et exploits sont souvent passés sous silence. Qui se souvient par exemple que lors des derniers Jeux paralympiques d’été de Pékin en 2008, 37 records du monde sont battus, 148 pays sont engagés, plus de 1000 médailles sont décernées et 4 200 sportifs et sportives sont impliqués ? En dépit de nombreux travaux « sectoriels » sur les différentes formes de déficience et handicap (qui concerne entre 5 et 27 % de la population selon l’acception retenue), sur les vulnérabilités sportives et sur l’histoire des Jeux paralympiques reposant sur des dizaines d’épreuves sportives handisport, il n’existe aucune enquête d’envergure sur l’histoire sociale des mouvements paralympiques suisses et français et de leurs élites sportives (médaillées lors des Jeux paralympiques). Cette faiblesse de la littérature est d’autant plus étonnante que les travaux historiques et sociologiques ont souligné le rôle central de ces deux pays, en ce qui concerne aussi bien les processus de création, d’institutionnalisation et de développement des Jeux olympiques (rénovés en 1896 à Athènes) que des Jeux paralympiques d’été et d’hiver en 1960 et 1976. La Suisse et la France ont également été des nations motrices dans la naissance du Comité International Paralympique en 1989 à Düsseldorf en Allemagne. Par ailleurs, malgré la présence d’une centaine de champions multimédaillés, la Suisse et la France brillent par leur nombre considérable de participations aux Jeux paralympiques et de sacres paralympiques : en effet, de 1960 à 2010, la Suisse a remporté 450 médailles (dont 109 par des femmes) et la France 898 (dont 405 par des femmes). Loin d’une approche hagiographique, ce projet de recherche propose donc de combler les lacunes de la littérature historique et sociologique. A partir des premiers Jeux paralympiques à nos jours, il vise à analyser l’histoire sociale des mouvements paralympiques suisses et français et de leurs élites. En se focalisant sur les médaillés paralympiques, cette enquête inédite et ambitieuse, au carrefour de quatre histoires (du handicap, de la santé, de l’élite sportive et du mouvement paralympique) a pour objectif de mener une approche comparative suisso-française. Ainsi, en combinant méthode prosopographique et entretiens « récits de vie » avec 80 médaillés paralympiques suisses et français (femmes et hommes confondus) et en nous appuyant sur des archives écrites principalement issues des Comités Paralympiques Suisses et Français et du Comité International Paralympique, nous pourrons interroger les processus institutionnels de transformation des mouvements paralympiques dans ces deux pays et mettre en évidence sur le long terme les processus communs et les différences entre les carrières sportives et les trajectoires sociales de ces champions suisses et français en terme d’origine socioculturelle, de socialisation sportive, de rapport au handicap et enfin de reconversion.

The sub-projects in this proposal further develop areas of research in the fields of materials chemistry and sustainable energy. The completion of the ERC LiLo support also loses valuable Postdoctoral experience from the research group and the request for one Postdoctoral stipend in this proposal is an essential part of ensuring continuity in our research program.Sub-project A will continue the SNF support of two PhD students, Frederik Malzner and Annika Büttner (currently in their first and second years of doctoral studies, respectively), and will develop photosensitizers and modify components in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) using Earth abundant metals. We will focus on (i) structural tuning of copper-based dyes to enhance their photoresponse and electron injection, and (ii) development of new redox shuttles to replace the classical I3-/I- electrolyte which is optimized for ruthenium dyes. Postdoctoral support is required in this project for the development of quasi-solid state DSCs.Sub-project B will develop molecular emitters for application in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) and will support doctoral student Sarah Keller who starts her third year in September 2015. The use of emissive coordination complexes containing copper, rather than the more usual iridium, is a principal objective, and the holy grail is to deliver white-light emitters with high luminance and long lifetimes under device conditions. Our longstanding collaboration with Henk Bolink and Enrique Ortí (University of Valencia) provides this project with essential support for device measurements and theoretical interpretation of emission behaviour; Dr Bolink is one of the world's leading experts in LEC technology with first hand experience in the lighting industry.In sub-project C, we will develop strategies for the construction of 3-dimensional networks (metal-organic frameworks, MOFs) with tectons comprising multitopic metal-binding domains. Maximilian Klein (in his first year of doctorate study) will be supported in this project; his recent breakthrough in demonstrating that ditopic bis(3,2':6',3''-terpyridine) tectons are key to assembling 3-dimensional nets (as opposed to 2D or 1D architectures using 4,2':6',4''-terpyridines) is the starting point for the diversification of MOF structure-types and investigations of structure-property relationships and gas adsorption.

Early iterations of this literature focused on a few industrialized countries (Coenen et al. 2012) but more recently transition research has identified emerging economies and developing countries as major places where transition challenges are to be met. More specifically, scholars of the “geography of sustainability transitions” research strand (Truffer and Coenen 2012; Raven et al. 2012) recently provided conceptual guidance and empirical applications demonstrating how research in this field can be carried out (cf. a forthcoming special issue edited by Truffer, Murphy and Raven).  The present proposal aims at contributing to this emerging field of scholarship through the advancement of a geographically sensitive framework to study transition dynamics and an empirical focus on the provision of basic/utility services (esp. sanitation) in cities of the Global South.  Transitions towards more sustainable sector structures will depend on successful generation of new service-delivery options and on their large-scale implementation within local contexts.  Regarding the development of these offerings, the actors, networks and institutions, which form around new socio-technical configurations have been conceptualized as Technological Innovation Systems (TIS, see Bergek et al. 2008).  Successful implementation depends on whether and how these configurations fit into local institutional and infrastructural contexts or “socio-technical regimes” that govern public services in developing regions (Geels 2002).  As such, there is a fundamental scholarly challenge at work here, how to conceptualize, operationalize, and manage the diffusion or integration of TIS innovations into geographically distinct regimes such that they disrupt “business-as-usual” service provisioning and consumption systems and practices in ways that foster transitions toward sustainability. The proposal analyzes possible transition pathways in basic services, focusing specifically on the case of Nairobi, Kenya.  It will examine how new socio-technical configurations (conceptualized as specific TISs) interact with prevailing regime structures of these sectors.  Three conceptual building blocks are proposed to analyze these interactions: i) system failures for assessing the capacity of the TISs to develop disruptive innovations; ii) user and service provider practices as core elements of regime structures; and iii) legitimization and trust formation as core processes in the embedding of new service options into existing socio-technical regimes.  By analyzing these dimensions and their interaction, we aim at better identifying challenges and prospects for more or less “disruptive” innovations to emerge out of and be diffused from different TISs.  Utility services in developing countries are the target of many international aid organizations and actors forming different globalized TIS.  Hence, we will also analyze the role that multi-scalar actor networks play in disruptive innovation.  Conceptually, this research aims at contributing to the elaboration of a systemic understanding of innovation processes that contribute to sustainability transitions and therefore at providing an early reference case for “geography of sustainability transitions” research in contexts of the Global South. In broader terms, this research shall contribute to a more reflexive and institutionally sensitive approach for designing new utility services both by local actors and by international development agencies.

In particular public utilities have had difficulties expanding their services to the urban poor. Why is this the case despite utilities having improved their capabilities substantially over the last years? This paper investigates how innovation strategies of utilities are aligned or misaligned with the broader contexts in informal settlements which are populated by different socio technical regimes. We propose a framework to identify new capabilities needed by utilities to deal with these different regimes. The paper reconstructs pro poor initiatives of a water and sewerage utility in a large East African city and explains why they tended to fail in terms of livelihood improvement. We show how the alignment between capability portfolios and specific regime structures have set limits to the success of pro poor innovation strategies in informal settlement contexts.

The basic idea is to define a hypothetical situation where the place of the car would have been dramatically reduced and to use qualitative and quantitative simulation methods to examine the consequences of this initial hypothesis.To formalize our approach, we will design a counterfactual world in which the car has no use: a Post Car World. The objective is to conceive a world without cars (with four variants) in order to help us appraising the current role of automobile, to highlight its meaning in our modern societies and to envision new possibilities for mobility and spatial development. In order to understand the nature of this potential deep mutation and analyse the complexity of the current ‘car-society’, a comprehensive and synergistic approach will be carried out. In brief, this project is based on the idea that by simulating the future through scenarios we can understand the present better.

One of these emerging issues is the growing transnational mobility of early career researchers and their gendered effects regarding academic career paths. Mobility is often presented as an indispensable element in the career trajectories: A stay - or multiple stays - abroad at other universities or research institutes is today often considered as a normative requirement of a successful academic career, in Switzerland or beyond. In other words, transnational mobility is an important pre-condition of career progression, and many young scientists do not just do a ‘stint’ abroad, but make several moves that take them into their late thirties. Once primarily associated with areas such as physics and biology, recent trends suggest that the demand of mobility is becoming a more generalized dimension of academic careers. At the same time, a set of studies brought to light that this institutionalization of mobility of young academics has important effects on (re)producing gender inequalities and overall that mobility has a highly gendered character. Constraints on mobility are gendered and research has notably shown that parenting hinders the mobility of women to a greater extent than it does men, further impeding their career progression. However, little is known to this day of how we can fully understand the mechanisms by which these gender regimes are (re)produced, contested or transformed in daily practices, social networks, partnerships and family relations, and within universities. This lack of understanding is due to different research gaps: First, research on highly skilled migration - young academics comprise category - often render families and social networks invisible (problem of ‘methodological individualism’) and therefore remains highly undertheorized. Second, the diversity of practices among women and men is not sufficiently taken into account, thereby not eliciting practices which move away from hegemonic normative conceptions of masculinity and femininity. Finally, there is an overall lack of a gender approach which would focus on the mechanisms of gender differentiation and not reduce the differences between men and women to terms of mere variables. The proposed research aims at tackling these gaps while asking: In which ways is gender articulated with mobility patterns of young academics (men and women) and, conversely, how does this specific type of mobility reinforce or transform gender regimes? We follow a gender approach that understands gender as a relational and analytical category: Gender and gender regimes are actively reproduced in social practices and interactions (‘doing’ and ‘undoing’ gender) and are therefore open to change. Furthermore, we argue that we can best understand the gendered mobility patterns of young scientists by mobilizing three interrelated theoretical perspectives: A life-story approach, a social network approach, and a ‘social field’ approach to academia. Methodologically, we follow a mixed-method approach conducting research in three universities from different countries. We intend first to conduct an online survey with young academics from the selected universities. Second, we will conduct biographic-narrative and network interviews with young academics experiencing a transnational mobility and, when they are coupled, we will interview their partners as well. The scientific originality of our project is twofold: First, we contribute to the ongoing debate within gender studies showing the mechanisms by which gender regimes under conditions of transnationalization are at the same time stable but also modified by actors. Second, by understanding the mobility of highly skilled young researchers as a specific form of migration, we aim at linking two different fields of investigation - international migration and highly skilled mobility - which are only rarely articulated.","Ethnology","Humanities and Social Sciences;Ethnology, social and human geography","Maison d'analyse des processus sociaux MAPS Université de Neuchâtel","Switzerland","University of Neuchatel - NE","Project funding (Div.

Es gewinnt methodisches Profil und sachliche Tiefe durch eine Reflexion auf Struktur, Dynamik, Implikationen und Konsequenzen des Unterscheidens, das im Kern dieses Lehrstücks angelegt ist.Die Erwählungslehre hat einen schlechten Leumund - insbesondere dann, wenn mit ihr das massgeblich von Calvin geprägte Bild eines Gottes in Verbindung gebracht wird, der die einen erwählt und die anderen verwirft. Im Horizont von Pluralismus und Toleranz erscheint das Lehrstück daher als abgehoben, anstössig, antiquiert und als ein ernst zu nehmender Gegenstand allein für biblisch-exegetische sowie (theologie-)historische Forschung. Wird die Erwählungslehre dort tatsächlich in grosser Breite bearbeitet, geht die neuere Materialdogmatik zu diesem Lehrstück stark auf Distanz. Dies erscheint schon angesichts der zentralen systematisch-theologischen Stellung der Erwählungslehre problematisch. Sie behandelt die Frage nach dem Zugang zum Heil unter den Prämissen eines evangelischen Glaubensverständnisses, und so besteht eine enge Beziehung zu allen wichtigen Themen der Dogmatik: zu Gotteslehre, Christologie und Pneumatologie ebenso wie zu Ekklesiologie und Anthropologie. Gegen eine Marginalisierung dieses Lehrstücks spricht auch, dass in seinem Kontext eine wichtige theologische Reflexion erfolgen kann: ob und inwiefern Gott als einer zu denken ist, der Unterscheidungen an sich, seiner Schöpfung sowie seinen Geschöpfen trifft, inwiefern diese heilsrelevant sind, und wie sich menschliches Unterscheiden in Sachen des Glaubens bzw. der Religion zu diesem Unterscheiden Gottes in Beziehung setzt. Eine solche Reflexion hat erhebliche sozial-politische Implikationen, wie man beispielsweise an Max Webers Thesen zur Protestantischen Ethik oder an der in den USA beheimateten Rede von der ‹elected nation› bzw. ‹God’s own nation› nachvollziehen kann; auch Bezüge zur gesellschaftlichen Debatte um die Gewaltaffinität des Monotheismus lassen sich herstellen.Innerhalb des Projekts soll erstens in Auseinandersetzung mit u.a. George Spencer-Brown eine Methodik entwickelt werden, welche die Analyse von Unterscheidungsstrukturen erlaubt. Diese soll dann zweitens auf klassische theologische Positionen (Calvin, Schleiermacher, Barth) angewandt werden, um die Ergebnisse dann drittens auf gegenwärtige theologische und gesellschaftlich-politische Problemlagen zu beziehen und produktiv weiterzudenken.","Religious studies, Theology","Humanities and Social Sciences;Theology & religious studies, history, classical studies, archaeology, prehistory and early history","Hermeneutik und Religionsphilosophie Theologische Fakultät Universität Zürich","Switzerland","University of Zurich - ZH","Project funding (Div.

Im vorliegenden Projekt „Size Matters“ geht es in diesem Sinne um dreierlei: Erstens tauchen in der bildenden Kunst der letzten 15 Jahre vermehrt Modelle als künstlerische Ausdrucksform auf, und es gilt, diesen Ansatz für die Kunstproduktion systematisch weiter zu entwickeln. Zweitens gibt es in der künstlerischen Forschung die Suche nach sinnvollen Formaten, künstlerische und wissenschaftliche Forschung zu verknüpfen, und hier sind Modelle als Methode besonders vielversprechend. Und drittens erhält die Frage nach der gesellschaftlichen Bedeutung der Kunst in der Kunstkritik und -theorie durch das Konzept des Kunstwerks als Modell eine fruchtbare Wendung. Für das vorliegende Projekt können diese Forschungsinteressen erfreulicherweise mit solchen aus den Wissenschaften verknüpft werden:Das Projekt „Size Matters“ widmet sich Modellen aus den Künsten und Wissenschaften als transdisziplinäre Objekte par excellence. Im Vordergrund steht dabei die Skalierung als Erkenntnistechnik - ebenfalls ein transdisziplinäres Forschungsfeld -, und als Austragungsort fokussiert das Projekt auf den Windkanal. Dabei wird der Windkanal verstanden als Ort der Formfindung, als aerodynamisches Labor, als wissenschaftshistorische Einrichtung und als künstlerische Metaphernmaschine. U.a. wird ein Ansatz wieder aufgenommen, den György Kepes bereits in den 1960er Jahren als „crisis of scale“ betitelte und mit dem er die grundlegende Verwandlung der Gesellschaften im 20. Jahrhundert beschrieb. „We may suffer from the new scale, but we have to go forward and meet it.“ (Kepes 1969, iv) Und dieses „go forward“ sieht Kepes in der Kunst, die die visuelle Performanz in ihren Werken über Skalierungseffekte erzeugt. Für das Kunstschaffen wiederum beispielhaft erscheinen Kepes gezielte Verzerrungen an einem Windkanalmodell eines Flugzeugs: „Aeroplanes are designed […], when they make small models, not in the exact dimensions that they will be, but they have to distort it to perform the small model scale the same as it will be in the large scale […].“ (Kepes o.J.)Im engeren Projektteam arbeiten ein Künstler und ein Kunsthistoriker zusammen mit zwei künstlerisch und einer/m kunsthistorisch Promovierenden, und diese Arbeitsgruppe ergänzt sich über ein internationales Netzwerk und jährlich stattfindende Veranstaltungen mit benachbarten Disziplinen wie z.B. Aerodynamik, Wissenschaftsgeschichte, Ästhetik. Im Kernteam wird die disziplinäre Konstellation dazu genutzt, die gemeinsamen Interessen an Modellen in der Kunst, an der Skalierung und an der Geschichte der Windkanäle zu koppeln und die Zusammenarbeit im Sinne einer Fahrkunst zu organisieren (eine Technologie zur Fahrung in einem Bergwerksschacht bestehend aus zwei sich bewegenden Leitern, die im richtigen Takt gewechselt werden müssen): das Team betrachtet sein Problemfeld abwechselnd mit den Augen der Kunst und dann wieder mit den Augen der Kunstgeschichte und arbeitet jeweils einmal in der Domäne der Objekte und dann wieder in der der Sprache. Dabei geht es um die Schärfung des Gedankens ebenso wie der disziplinären Formulierungen, die durch den Rhythmus der Medienwechsel gefordert und entwickelt werden.Am Ende des dreijährigen Projekts stehen drei Promotionen und Teile einer Habilitation, sowie eine Anzahl neuer Kunstwerke, Publikationen zu einer Theorie der Skalierung in Kunst und Aerodynamik, Beispiele für den Windkanal als Aufführungsort, eine Publikation zu Windkanalmodellen als Boundary Objects zwischen Kunst und Wissenschaft, und schliesslich eine projektinterne Auswertung der transdisziplinären Zusammenarbeit insbes. bezüglich des Modus der Fahrkunst.

Diese Entwicklung ist auch in den Gefängnissen zu spüren. Häufig ist die Implementierung von Sicherheitsmassnahmen im Freiheitsentzug in stärkerem Masse einem öffentlichen Bedürfnis nach Sicherheit geschuldet, als einem tatsächlichen Bedarf zusätzlicher Sicherung. Pannen, wie Entweichungen oder Vorfälle von Gewalt innerhalb der Vollzugsanstalt, die Unsicherheit und Ärger in der Öffentlichkeit hervorrufen könnten, sollen mit immer repressiveren Mitteln vermieden werden. Die Aufrechterhaltung der Ordnung innerhalb der Institution wird so zu einem immer zentraleren Ziel. Dies führt in den Gefängnissen zu einer verstärkten Kontrolle des Restrisikos und zu einer zunehmend ausgeprägteren Einschränkung der persönlichen Freiheit der Insassen, was sich negativ auf den Erfolg etwaiger Resozialisierungsbemühungen auswirkt und konträr zum Leben in Freiheit, wo ein gewisses Risiko zugunsten der individuellen Freiheit in Kauf genommen werden muss, steht. Dieses Vorgehen entbehrt vielfach fundierter wissenschaftlicher Grundlagen. Bisher ist nicht umfassend bekannt, wie Sicherheitsrisiken im Strafvollzug entstehen. Insbesondere fehlt es an komplexen Modellen, die mehrere Ebenen (strukturelle Merkmale der Institution, Eigenschaften der Insassen und Insassinnen, Merkmale und Einstellungen der Angestellten) einbeziehen.Die Fragestellung der geplanten Studie - die Frage nach den Faktoren und komplexen Zusammenhängen, welche die Sicherheit eines Gefängnisses beeinflussen - knüpft direkt an die Fragen des SNF Vorläufer Projekts „Sicherheit - Alltag des Strafvollzugspersonals“ an. Während das Vorläufer Projekt das Verständnis und die Herstellung von Sicherheit vorwiegend mit Hilfe von ethnographischen und diskursanalytischen Methoden in einer Anstalt untersucht, basiert das vorliegende Projekt auf quantitativen Ansätzen. Vorgesehen ist, neben der Berücksichtigung verschiedener Anstaltstypen und den drei Konkordaten, Vergleiche zwischen den drei grössten Sprachregionen durchzuführen und so die im Vorgängerprojekt zunächst beantragte und durch den Nationalfonds zurück gestellte gesamtschweizerische Sicht zu ermöglichen. Datengrundlage ist die ebenfalls im Rahmen des Vorgänger Projekts durchgeführte Befragung der Mitarbeitenden in Institutionen des Freiheitsentzugs, die durch Daten des Bundesamts für Statistik ergänzt wird.***The impact of the concepts of security and risk in public discussions, political decision making as well as in the organisation of daily life within society is increasing. This general trend can equally be observed within prisons. The introduction of new security measures within the prison system is often more due to a heightened demand for security in the general public than to an actual requirement. The maintenance of order is becoming an increasingly central aim of correctional facilities and the measures to ensure this aim are becoming more and more repressive. As a consequence of this development the individual liberty of inmates is ever more restricted, which has a negative impact on rehabilitative efforts and creates a situation behind the prison walls which is marked by a growing contrast to life in liberty, where a residual risk is accepted as the price of a high level of individual freedom. To date there is no scientific evidence about the emergence of security risks in the prison setting and the current practice of intensifying technical means to ensure order inside prisons suffers from the lack of an established scientific foundation. In particular, complex models which take into account different levels (institution, characteristics of inmates, characteristics of staff) are missing. The present project aims to change this situation and to expose the different factors determining security and order in correctional facilities and their interrelations. The core of the study is the development of a differentiated model to explain the emergence of security within the prison context. The central question of the planned project - the question of factors which have an effect on security in prison - draws on the questions of the previous SNF project “Security in the daily work of prison staff: A study on dispositives, practice, discourse and attitudes in a Swiss medium security prison”. Whereas the previous project examined the understanding and production of security in a swiss medium security prison from an ethnographical and discourse analytical perspective, the present study employs quantitative research methods. Besides comparisons between different types of correctional facilities and concordates, a comparison between the three major language regions, which was already planned for the previous project and deferred by the Swiss National Science Foundation, will also be conducted. The data for the proposed analysis is already available, as it will be drawn from the survey of correctional employees which was conducted in addition to the qualitative study during the previous project. Supplementary data from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office will also be used.","Sociology","Humanities and Social Sciences;Sociology, social work, political sciences, media and communication studies, health","Departement für Sozialarbeit und Sozialpolitik Université de Fribourg","Switzerland","University of Fribourg - FR","Project funding (Div.

Rather than conceiving of the non-Western present against the backdrop of supposedly authentic, homogenous, and undiluted traditions, this project focuses on the historiographic construction of art and visual culture as intertwined agents and expressions of sociopolitical modernization. It proposes art and performance as parallel arenas through which cultural identity comes to be perceived neither as a search for roots nor a striving for Westernization, but as a process of coming-into-being within a framework of shifting cultural and political hegemonies.The notion of modernity as phenomenon that destroys the present in order to build a new future - a tabula rasa phenomenon completely opposed to tradition - is particularly complicated in the case of non-Western settings. Whereas in the West, where the conceptualization of ‘the modern’ as a post-Enlightenment project of utopian rationality responded against existing traditions, sublimating them into new forms, elsewhere modernization was often understood as erasing local culture in favor of a template borrowed from the West. For example, in much of the Arab world of the early twentieth century, the word ‘ruwwad’, pioneers, was used to designate modern artists, as if they were acting in a barren desert rather than in an already rich and vital cultural context. Historiographies of non-Western arts have often followed such a model, viewing artistic production as a belated import rather than a complex part of ongoing cultural change and local processes of modernization. Consequently, ‘tradition’, viewed in opposition to modernity, has often been understood as already finished and only available for revival, even when existing practices have survived into the present, particularly in forms of performance associated with indigenous or rural peoples. Thus the fine arts, associated with modernity, and ‘traditional’ arts, often commodified in the production of nostalgia or marketed for tourists, serve together as a means of simplifying the complex processes of cultural mixing that this project seeks to unravel. By bringing together the study of cultural production, its preservation, and its commodification, this project aims to reinscribe the agency of artists, arts institutions, and commodity production in the history and analysis of non-Western culture as a socio-political phenomenon. To this end, the project will:•study the historiographic divergence between the study of pre-modern non-Western arts and the relative inattention paid to the modern era. It thus aims to establish a paradigm for the study of the modern art (as opposed to much more popular contemporary art) of the non-West, a geo-temporal phenomenon generally excluded from art historical consideration, but nonetheless central to understanding tropes of national identity construction that extend to the present.•examine the political instrumentalization of art as an agent of modernization within the context of broader practices of visual culture. Rather than conceiving of the visual arts within a domain of elite practice or connoisseurial success, it examines art as a document of modern identity production in line with other visual practices such as clothing or advertising. •develop specific case studies to suggest the range of the field and encourage future investment in academic positions and public exhibitions of non-Western modern arts and establish research and teaching on these topic within the academic field and affiliated institutions.•investigate the differential between the stated and apparent objectives of exhibitions of non-Western modern arts and their actual engagement with audiences as measured qualitatively through issues of access (such as distance from communities, activities offered, etc.)•develop a broader synergy between this project, the public, and institutions with similar interests in Switzerland, Europe and the Middle East, which will serve as a focal case study relying on the expertise of the project leaders.","Visual arts and Art history","Humanities and Social Sciences;Art studies, musicology, theatre and film studies, architecture","Unité d'arabe Faculté des Lettres Université de Genève","Switzerland","University of Geneva - GE","Sinergia","in-depth/constructive exchanges on approaches, methods or results","France","01.02.2016","31.03.2017","Peer-reviewed","Contribution to book (peer-reviewed)","Writing the History of Modern Art in the Arab World: Documents, Theories and Reality","Published","2017","978-3-8376-4061-8","10.14361/9783839440612-003","","Global Art History.

Elle demeure encore aujourd’hui un secteur clé au point de vue économique et fait partie des clichés communément avancés pour définir, à côté du chocolat, des montres et des banques, ce qui fait l’excellence helvétique. Or, curieusement, son histoire n’a pas suscité un intérêt passionné. Portée par une conjoncture qui, avec d’autres, la met au centre du développement économique de la Suisse par les enjeux qu’elle recoupe et les ambitions qu’elle traduit, l’hôtellerie a pourtant défini de nouveaux cadres de références sociaux, professionnels, financiers et techniques qui ont eu des influences durables sur des pans entiers de la société. La recherche projetée ici se propose de dresser un panorama de l’hôtellerie suisse pour la première moitié du 20ème siècle, période peu étudiée jusqu’à aujourd’hui faute de sources transversales. Elle tentera de répondre à la question de savoir si un modèle particulier existe et qui lui aurait servi à la fois de définition et de référence. Dans cette approche globale, il sera alors possible de mettre en évidence certains points d’ancrage, que ce soit au niveau économique, technique, géographique et social, afin de mieux préciser la structure du tissu helvétique et de comprendre la politique hôtelière de la Suisse en matière d’attractivité et de dynamisme. L’analyse sera donc portée tant sur les acteurs de l’hôtellerie et les infrastructures en présence que sur les réseaux économiques avec lesquels ils sont en relation. Dans cette perspective, trois axes seront plus particulièrement développés qui donnent à la trajectoire helvétique un profil particulier: les configurations que l’hôtellerie suisse légitime, les espaces qu’elle occupe et les usages qu’elle privilégie. Pour ce faire, la recherche partira des résultats de la vaste enquête lancée, en 1943, par la Société suisse de Crédit hôtelier (SSCH) afin de déterminer comment la politique hôtelière suisse a été élaborée, avec quels outils elle a été mise en place et quels buts ce secteur pensait atteindre. En remettant en cause certaines décisions qui touchent les politiques de développement suivies, les stratégies commerciales adoptées et les bases économiques et financières sur lesquelles elle était fondée, la crise traversée par l’hôtellerie avec l’éclatement de la Première Guerre mondiale et qui se prolonge, avec plus ou moins d’intensité, durant toute l’entre-deux-guerres jette en effet une lumière crue sur les tenants et les aboutissants de sa substance. Elle pousse ses responsables et ses dirigeants à faire, durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale, un bilan de la situation sur le plan de la qualité des établissements, de leur localisation et des investissements afin de garantir les meilleures chances de succès dans le futur. L’évaluation portée par la SSCH qui s’impose, dès sa création en 1921 par la Confédération, comme le centre de compétence sur l’hôtellerie est donc d’une extrême importance parce que, si son intention est de dessiner le plus précisément possible ce que devra être l’hôtellerie à l’avenir, elle le fait à partir de la situation qui existe en 1943 et qui est le reflet d’une évolution perceptible dès la fin du 19ème siècle. En se penchant sur une période de difficultés conjoncturelles aiguës, le projet sera ainsi mieux à même de définir le paradigme dans lequel l’hôtellerie a évolué jusqu’à la fin de la Seconde Guerre mondiale. La recherche a pour ambition de couvrir le territoire helvétique dans son ensemble, dans la mesure où une vue globale du secteur hôtelier paraît pertinente pour saisir les enjeux des dispositifs mis en place. Sur le plan méthodologique, cette approche permettra ainsi d’établir des points de comparaison au niveau régional. Les enjeux ne sont en effet pas limités à une portion du territoire, mais bien au secteur hôtelier dans son ensemble, faute de quoi, des éléments importants pourraient échapper à l’analyse.

The effectiveness of immune defence mechanisms targeting microbial pathogens is largely determined by signals initiated by pattern recognition receptors (PRR) expressed in dendritic cells (DCs), which are the central coordinators of innate and acquired immune responses. Little is known about how DCs detect retroviruses and help mount an effective protective immunity against HIV-1. Recent observations from the Luban laboratory showing on the one hand that the HIV-1 restriction factor TRIM5 is a retroviral-specific PRR and on the other hand demonstrating that the lentiviral accessory protein Vpx, is capable of effectively abrogating the capacity of DCs to resist HIV-1 infection, offer a unique handle on the molecular mechanisms underlying the capacity of DCs to function as key decision making sites along the pathway leading from initial challenge to full blown AIDS. The aim of this project based on the complementary expertise on HIV-1 biology (Luban lab, group A), analytical proteomics (Hopfgartner lab, group B) and bioinformatics (Lisacek lab, group C) is to utilize a systems biology approach to unravel the mechanisms by which DCs determine disease outcome in the first few hours post-infection and relies on an innovative integrated analytical proteomics/bioinformatics platform. Large quantities of primary human DCs will be generated from peripheral blood monocytes of individual healthy donors (monocyte-derived DCs or moDCs). Exploiting experimental treatments developed in the lab of Group A (J. Luban), these cells will either elaborate a potent, innate, antiviral state that suppresses HIV-1 infection to undetectable levels or they will be rendered completely permissive for HIV-1 infection, even in the face of exogenous type 1 interferon (IFN). Group A will generate these moDCs; confirm the anti-viral or viral permissive states in samples subjected to proteomics analysis; will compare protein expression results emerging from the proteomics study with mRNA levels of expression; and will perform molecular and functional studies to characterize newly discovered pathways. In parallel to this, qualitative and quantitative (QUAL/QUAN) proteomic acquisition workflows will be developed in Group B (G. Hopfgartner) on the basis of novel fast MS acquisition (below 100 msec duty cycle) with resolution power above 30’000 and nano-ultra high performance liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC - MS/MS) instrumentation using innovative unsupervised and supervised MS or MS/MS data acquisition and processing concepts. In addition, in order to generate relevant biological data of the required high-caliber, implementation of quality-control protocols from method development to data processing will be carried out in parallel and in continual synergy with Group C (F. Lisacek). In particular, Group C will develop iterative and integrated analytical proteomics/bioinformatics processes with a threefold aim in accordance with the three specific aims of the project: First, they will devise and perform the MS-based data analysis to dig deep into the mechanisms of the proteomic regulation of IFN-induced anti-viral states and of viral escape pathways. To this end, they will analyze the data coming from the three types of MS experiments in an iterative, result-driven way by focusing the MS analysis in successive replicates on not yet identified proteins. They will create spectrum libraries of all confident peptide identifications annotated with the quantitative profiles. Second, Group C will use these libraries to plan subsequent selected reaction monitoring (SRM) measurements. Third, they will support the interpretation of the quantitative results by means of dedicated pathway visualization and protein annotations methods.","Molecular Biology","Biology and Medicine;Basic Biological Research","Laboratoire de spectrométrie de masse du vivant Université de Genève","Switzerland","University of Geneva - GE","Sinergia",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"https://survey3.zsi.at/index.php/admin/responses/sa/view/surveyid/718586/id/365",2021-10-14 17:26:22,9,"en",493199529,"3tfJO2CQzr571ho",2021-10-14 17:18:13,2021-10-14 17:26:22,"129.194.154.179",NA,"8","60ies","e",5,"Y","NA","6",8,7,5,1,NA,NA,NA,"Y","Y",NA,2,"2","0","NA","0","0","0","cocr","cocr",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0","0","1","0","1",1,1,"1","0","1","N","N","3","5","3","2","0","0","8","und","und","und",NA,NA,NA,"beh",NA,99,NA,NA,NA,NA,8,7,"2",2,4,7,1,"0","1","0","0","NA","1","0","0","1","0","0","7","2","5",1,NA,NA,NA

For both historical and methodological reasons, the models used to describe these mechanisms in humans have tended to neglect the basal ganglia (BG) and concentrate mainly on the cortex   a state of affairs dubbed the 'cortical bias' by some researchers (Berridge, 2003). And yet, given their tripartite functional compartmentalization, whereby each BG is linked to either the motor, associative or limbic cortex, there is every reason to suppose that these structures play a major role in emotional processing in humans, due not just to their intrinsic function but also to their functional and effective connectivity* with the rest of the brain. There is growing evidence for the involvement of the BG in emotional processing, especially for emotions conveyed by the human voice (i.e., emotional prosody), not only directly, but also through their connections with structures known to be involved in emotional processing, such as the superior temporal gyrus. This involvement has been revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), neuroelectrophysiological and lesion studies, as well as by deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the BG, a neurosurgical technique which has recently drawn researchers’ attention to the possible functional roles of these structures in human emotional processing. Nevertheless, the precise nature of these roles in emotional processes and the way in which they differ among the different BG and between the BG and cortical structures (i.e., functional specialization) has yet to be fully elucidated. Furthermore, the way in which these subcortical and cortical structures synchronize (or desynchronize) in order to allow the emergence of a cognitive process such as emotional prosody recognition (i.e., functional integration) remains largely unexplored in affective psychology and affective neuroscience. The present project follows on from the FNRS project no. 105314_124572 entitled “Emotional prosody: an integration of cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience approaches” undertaken by Professor Grandjean's group. It is intended to enhance our current understanding of the functional specialization and integration of the BG that subtends emotional prosody processing in humans. It will adopt a resolutely cross-disciplinary approach, combining affective psychology with experimental cognitive psychology applied to affective processing, neuropsychology, neurology, functional neuroimaging and neurosurgery, neurophysiology, and signal processing. We intend to use a number of different research models, in order to obtain a set of convergences between different techniques and populations. Adopting three separate lines of enquiry, we will use (i) fMRI in healthy participants, coupled with methods for analyzing functional and effective connectivity, (ii) intracranial electrophysiological recordings in patients with Parkinson’s disease in order to analyze intrinsic effective connectivity across the different territories of two BG targeted by DBS (subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus), and (iii) the study of the behavioural effects of BG DBS in Parkinson’s disease, coupled with metabolic imaging. In addition to its fundamental interest, the present research project will open up new avenues in applied research. It will enable adjustments to be made to the positioning of the stimulation electrodes in order to avoid side effects and thus leading to improvements in the surgical technique and thus improving the quality of life of patients receiving DBS. Finally, the research on the modulation of emotions in humans via DBS will boost research on new indications for this surgery in the field of neuropsychiatry, such as depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder.*Whereas 'functional connectivity' is concerned with correlations between data collected in different brain structures, 'effective connectivity' is concerned with the influence that one system exerts on the other.

For decades, inter- and intraindividual differences (and variability, altogether) were often regarded by developmental psychologists as mere noise, or, at best, of interest uniquely for applied psychology. In contrast, the last decade has witnessed an increase of interest in the study of variability, considering that it constitutes a fundamental phenomenon, of interest in and for itself. Indeed, variability is fundamentally linked with change, as well as with plasticity which has given rise to much interest, recently. Four types of variability should be distinguished, each of which is liable to vary with age: interindividual differences (between individuals), intraindividual change (i.e., change within individuals across time, which requires a longitudinal design for estimation that is, assessing the same individuals repeatedly in time), intraindividual short-term fluctuations in performance (also labelled inconsistency), and fluctuations across tasks (also called dispersion). It has been hypothesized for a long time that interindividual differences tend to increase in older adulthood, relative to young adults. Empirical evidence is, however, still scarce. A number of studies in the last decade have also shown that intraindividual variability (inconsistency), discriminates between younger and older adults, and between normal and demented older adults. A higher level of inconsistency  has usually been associated with a less desirable cognitive profile, at least in older adults. Studying concurrently these diverse types of variability requires large, multivariate designs, with tasks composed of a large number of trials. The human cost involved in carrying out such studies probably explains why empirical work is still so scarce.We launched a study in 2005, focusing on age differences across the lifespan in three of the four types of individual variability: interindividual differences, within-task intraindividual variability (short-term fluctuations) and across-task intraindividual variability (again within-subject). Thus, school-age children (aged 9 to 12 years), young adults and older adults were all examined with the same 10 tasks, varying in complexity; a number of other tasks were used too, including the Raven Matrices that taps fluid intelligence. Most tasks used a large number of trials, to make it possible to compute indices of intraindividual variability, including modelisations of individual distributions of response times (such as parameters derived from ex-Gaussian distributions). A large variability was observed, overall larger in children than in older adults, but also larger (although less consistently so) in older adults than in young adults. Results were intriguing enough, in terms of age differences, to start a longitudinal study to follow individuals over time. This study, presently in progress, was restricted to older adults. The same set of tasks was administered to all older adults examined during the first cross-sectional study (2005-2008), as well as to a second sample of older adults, recruited in 2008-2010. Preliminary results show that a) the large variability in cognitive performance observed in the initial sample is replicated; b) intraindividual indices of variability  correlate across the two times of measurement, suggesting that interindividual differences in terms of intraindividual variability are moderately stable; c) cognitive change across the 2 - 2.5 years (testing interval) is itself very variable: Some older adults (a slight majority) became slower and more variable with age, but others became faster and/or less variable. It is possible that, as is often the case in longitudinal studies, results reflect a confound of both developmental change and practice effects. It is therefore crucial to perform an additional measure; it is known that practice effects are most marked on Time 2. Moreover, a testing interval of 2-3 years is not very long for older adults. It is therefore planned to examine again all older adults who are willing to come back to the laboratory. These represent a sample of approximately 170 older adults, who will be aged, by then, between 65 to 91 years of age.

We use live microscopy techniques and Chromatin immunoprecipitation to analyse the long-range organization of chromatin in the nucleus, and we dissect the mechanisms and consequences of its perturbation in mutants. Recent work examines how the position and dynamics of chromatin loci affect the repair of double strand breaks or of endogenous damage that arises during replication. Our work on heterochromatin organization in C. elegans has been ground-breaking and has led to identification of a histone methylation event (H3K9me) as a necessary targeting signal for chromatin binding to the nuclear periphery. Juxtaposition to the nuclear envelope is known to affect DNA repair both in yeast and higher eukaryotes. We are pursuing the mechanism of positioning and the impact that either loss of localization and/or H3K9me has on genome stability in worms. In yeast we are examine the molecular crosstalk of checkpoint kinases, nucleosome remodelers, and the subdiffusive mobility of chromatin (and its ultimate subnuclear position) during various repair events.

Dieser Frage wird anhand einer aktuellen und für die Soziale Arbeit relevanten Gesetzesänderung in der Schweiz nachgegangen: der Revision des Vormundschaftsrechts innerhalb des Zivilgesetzbuches. Die empirische Untersuchung fokussiert hierbei auf die Etablierung eines neuen Organisationstypus (Kindes- und Erwachsenenschutzbehörde) gemäss bundesrechtlicher Vorgabe sowie auf die Praxis der ebenfalls neu geregelten Einrichtung und Führung von Beistandschaften für Erwachsene. Auf der Grundlage der qualitativen Analyse unterschiedlichen Datenmaterials (Interviews, Gruppendiskussionen, Gesetzestexte, Verordnungen, Organigramme, Fallakten etc.) unter Verwendung der Verfahren der objektiven Hermeneutik (Oevermann et al 1979, Oevermann 2001a, S. 27-42) soll geklärt werden, welche Handlungsspielräume durch die Gesetzgebung für das berufliche Handeln eröffnet oder geschlossen werden, wie die beteiligten Organisationen und die Professionellen mit diesen Spielräumen und politischerseits gesetzten Rahmenbedingungen ihres Handelns umgehen und welche Logik den getroffenen Entscheidungen jeweils zugrunde liegt. Hierbei interessieren wir uns insbesondere für die Fragen, inwiefern sich gesetzliche Vorstrukturierungen auf die Entscheidungs- und Handlungsautonomie des Berufsstandes, seiner Organisationen und der konkreten Fachkräfte auswirken und welche Folgen dies für die erbrachten Leistungen hat. Die Wahl einer aktuellen und auf organisationaler Ebene äusserst folgenreichen Gesetzesreform erscheint in Bezug auf dieses Erkenntnisinteresse als günstig, da diese Fokussierung die Möglichkeit bietet, den Einfluss gesetzlicher Vorgaben auf die Ausgestaltung von Organisationen und das Handeln in ihnen gewissermassen von Beginn an zu untersuchen. Wir gehen ebenfalls davon aus, dass es sinnvoll ist, gesetzliche Reformen auch auf der Folie gegenwärtigen sozialen Wandels zu  betrachten.

Contributions from a conversation analytic multimodal perspective","public meetings; conversation analysis; participation; social interaction; turn-taking; interaction in large groups; video analysis; multimodality","This project (called SpIP-2 2016-2017, 18 months) constitutes the continuation of the previous one, still on-going (called SpIP-1 2013-2016, 3 years). SpIP-1 is being currently developed with success and very rich outputs, and 2 dissertations are being written. SpIP-1 also has represented considerable work of the team on an evolving corpus: this opens up new exciting topics of study, to be developed in SpIP-2. Importantly, SpIP-2 also concerns the completion of the 2 dissertations, which, given the amount of work and outputs of SpIP-1, will be almost finished but not entirely completed at the end of SpIP-1.SpIP-1 has offered an extensive study of a video corpus documenting a participatory project in urban planning concerning the transformation of a military site into a public park in the centre of the city of Lyon in France. This form of participatory democracy involves meetings with citizens, associations, and interest groups, the sharing of information gathered among various kinds of experts, exchanges with political representatives at various levels, discussions, and brainstorming sessions with the citizens, in which they elaborate proposals for the park, discuss plans and critically inspect the work in progress on the construction site. This kind of public and civic process represents an exemplary site for the study of institutional social interactions, of public speech both by novices and professionals, and of the collective elaboration of ideas. Adopting the approach of Conversation Analysis, the SpIP-1 project, according to the initial plan, has investigated the specific organization of these meetings, by focusing on turn-taking procedures (the way in which the right to talk is orchestrated among the numerous participants of the meetings) and on practices through which citizen elaborate proposals, discuss them, express and negotiate agreements and disagreements. These analyses also raise and respond to more general and innovative issues, such as the organization of talk in interaction in larger groups of participants; the institutional organization of opportunities to participate and the local and interactional definition of what ‘participation’ means; the multimodal (i.e. taking into account language, gesture, gaze, body postures, embodied manipulation of objects, and the arrangements of bodies in the environment) analysis of meetings including the embodied and visible practices for grasping turns and organizing actions, and the collective manipulation of texts and plans. Moreover, SpIP-1 has offered innovative insights about the longitudinal study of interactional processes, since the corpus studied covers 8 years of debates. The success of SpIP-1 has opened new important avenues for researching these phenomena, thanks to the collection of new data. SpIP-1 began as a project based on an initial video corpus collected by the PI between 2008 and 2012, covering the launching of the participatory consultation of citizens, the initial debates and collective ateliers on the plans with the architect. During SpIP-1 new data were collected in 2013-2014, concerning an important new phase of the project, the implementation of the plans in an emerging construction site, until its partial opening.  This evolution of the corpus, following the evolution of a long-time urban project, opens up new interesting questions: the participatory procedure has evolved from debating about the park as a discursive object (2008-2009), to the park as an object ‘in the planning’ (2012 on) and as a built environment critically inspected by the citizens (2013 on). On this basis, SpIP-2 aims first at completing the data collection (until the complete opening of the park, in 2016 or early 2017) in such a way to produce a total video interactional documentation of a participatory process lasting for almost 10 years - which represents an absolute novum not only in Conversation Analysis but broadly in the social sciences. Second, SpIP-2 aims at the study - not yet conceivable in SpIP-1 - of how discussions about the park evolve during its appropriation by the citizens not only as an idea, but as an emerging material object. More precisely, these new analyses concern a) different facets of the longitudinal development of the debates, b) an important focus on the various materialities and spatialities involved in the collective elaboration of the urban project, such as  plans and other visualizations, and the in fieri material architectural realization, c) the mobile apprehension of the park in the critical inspections by the citizens in visits of construction site with the architect, in historical visits organized by and for citizens, as well as in their everyday use of the partially - and then totally - opened park. These new foci constitute innovative contributions to contemporary important topics in Conversation Analysis and more broadly in linguistics, sociology and anthropology, concerning the interactional organization of institutionality, history, multimodality and mobility.","Romance languages and literature","Humanities and Social Sciences;Linguistics and literature, philosophy","Institut für Französische Sprach- und Literaturwissenschaft Universität Basel","Switzerland","University of Basel - BS","Project funding (Div.

Early systems focussed exclusively on pronunciation practice; now, however, applications are starting to emerge designed to carry out simple conversations with students and give them the opportunity to practice spontaneous speaking skills. Typically, a system of this kind will be deployed on the web, use small-vocabulary recognition, and structure interaction in some kind of game-like way. The novelty of the field, however, means that few solid results have emerged. Despite positive anecdotal studies, it still remains to be demonstrated that systems with these characteristics are in fact able to help students acquire language skills, and, if so, which features influence learning outcomes.Here, we propose a three-year project aimed at systematic investigation of the issues involved. Our starting point will be the CALL-SLT system which we built under an earlier SNF-funded project. We will develop the current CALL-SLT prototype in several directions; the goal is both to extend the state-of-the-art in speech-enabled CALL, and to enhance the system to the point where it will be feasible to carry out the experiments we have in mind. Specifically, we will implement and compare a range of different speech recognition and recognition feedback strategies, develop a flexible framework for specifying script-based interactive dialogue games, use this framework to develop a substantial quantity of course content, and embed the system inside a social network. Content development will focus on English and French as L2s, with a variety of L1s including at least French, German, Italian and English. During the second half of the project, we will use these resources to carry out a series of evaluations in secondary schools, universities and on the web. The web-based evaluations will be designed to contrast different versions of the system against each other and will be performed using crowd-sourcing methods, making it feasible to recruit large enough sets of subjects to perform controlled experiments. The resulting software base, including lingware and courseware, will be made generally available to the community in fully documented Open Source form. We will also release annotated learner speech corpora collected during the experiments.","Education and learning sciences, subject-specific education","Humanities and Social Sciences;Psychology, educational studies","ETI / TIM / ISSCO Université de Genève","Switzerland","University of Geneva - GE","Project funding (Div.

Subsequently, extensive photophysical characterization would be carried out to obtain structure related properties that could aid in the development of new class of emissive materials. As specific objectives, we plan to synthesize and investigate the luminescent properties of a) Au(III) cyclometallated complexes and (b) Au(I) carbene complexes, (c) Platinum(II) carbene complexes and their conjugated polymers. These metal centers in specific oxidation states coupled with unique ligand environments would be utilized to tailor the emissive nature of the materials. Several strategies are herein proposed towards the improvement of luminescence efficiencies and tackle application oriented issues such as long-term thermal and photostability for these particular classes of materials. Design strategy is adopted in such a way so as to prepare novel phosphorescent small molecule entities, and later utilize the same with little structural modification for building polymers and correlate the properties of model compounds (small molecules) to polymers. The unique electronic properties that arise from conjugated polymers can be advantageously used for a variety of optoelectronic applications, with proper attention paid to the design of the polymers in order to obtain good properties both in solution and solid-state. A combination of luminescent properties and novel structures of the organometallic complexes and polymers could lead to potential applications in the field of phosphorescent based organic light emitting devices (PHOLEDs), optical limiting materials and sensors.","Inorganic Chemistry","Mathematics, Natural- and Engineering Sciences;Chemistry","Institut für Chemie Universität Zürich","Switzerland","University of Zurich - ZH","Project funding (Div.

Identity is one mechanism that allows individuals to allocate attention by using their identity as a frame of reference to evaluate the appropriate selection of information and their respective implementation (Brusoni & Rosenkranz, 2014). This line of work concentrates on role identities, an identity construct that ties to the functional roles an individual executes (for example, the role of an academic). In particular we concentrate on role transition as the mechanism by which individuals move between different role identities in order to allocate their attention situationally. Extant research corroborates that individuals differ in the degree to which they prefer to segment or integrate role domains (Ashforth et al., 2000), which has been shown to impact their information sharing and decision making process. Already Nicholson (1984) provided evidence that role transition allows individuals to balance stability and change. In analyzing how role transition impacts an individual’s attention allocation, we build on and complement research in this field, to extend our understanding of what guides individual decision making. Second, and related, is the discussion about individuals as a precursor to organizational level performance. Yet, we know next to nothing about how the emerging discussion about individual level mechanisms of attention control aggregate into organizational level behavior and related performance.The objective is to understand how different role transition styles impact individual attention allocation and how this in turn effects their active engagement in exploitative and exploratory activities. This research project is composed of one conceptual and two empirical papers, one quantitative and one qualitative study. The conceptual paper has already received a revise and resubmit with AMR and is currently under revision. The quantitative study is based on data collection efforts, which have been concluded in the Fall of 2013. Based on simulation data and complementary questionnaire responses, we test a multi-level longitudinal moderated-mediation model. The qualitative study will make use of the extensive expertise at the chair in qualitative research methods, particularly experiments and verbal protocol analysis (VPA). This research addresses three central gaps in present research. First, we add to the discussion on how individuals balance and engage in exploitation vs. exploration activities from an identity perspective as a frame of reference to attention allocation. Second, we introduce role transition as a decision-making mechanism to explain decision-making performance. Finally, we provide interesting insights to how individual action aggregates within the organizational context to drive firm-level outcomes. Beyond the importance for research, managers could greatly benefit from a better understanding on what drives their individual attention within the organizational context to raise awareness of the impact their attention focus has on their information selection process, decision making, and notably, the innovativeness and performance results they generate.Based on ongoing research at the department and the findings of this research project, we will write three academic papers (one conceptual and two empirical), and will design a teaching module to be implemented in one of our courses at the Department of Management Technology and Economics at ETH Zurich. This teaching module will target both master and post-experience students in innovation management.","Science of management","Humanities and Social Sciences;Economics, law","Departement Management, Technologie und Ökonomie D-MTEC ETH Zürich","Switzerland","ETH Zurich - ETHZ","Project funding (Div.

In most Western European democracies the number and share of people of migrant origin is growing. At the same time, nationalist far-right parties are on the rise, mobilizing natives against migrants on cultural and ethnicity-related grounds. In this changing environment, it is important to understand how migrants’ identification with their receiving country is affected by such nationalist appeals and how this, in turn, influences their political integration.  A burgeoning literature reports differences in issue attitudes, values, political participation, and party choice between (naturalized and non-naturalized) migrants and natives. As documented by a series of recently published articles (and conference papers), this appears also to apply to the Swiss case (Ladner 2014; Strijbis 2014). These differences in political opinion and behavior between these two social groups, we argue, derive from differences in strength and understanding of national identity. In general, we argue that surprisingly little is known about: 1) political parties impact on migrants’ social and national identities; and, 2) how migrants’ social identities stand against conventional factors of issue attitudes and political engagement in the context of nationalist appeals. None of the existing opinion survey data (ISSP, EVS, Selects), in which also Switzerland is included, comprise all the components that are relevant to study of migrants’ national identities and their political integration. For this purpose, we plan to conduct a survey on immigrants in Switzerland. With this initial survey we establish baseline information on potential probands, which we will recruit for a series of experiment studies. We conduct a coherent set of experiments in order to better understand how migrants’ identities are shaped by political debates, and how parties’ group-centered issue appeals affect naturalized migrants’ issue attitudes and political behavior. In particular, little is yet known about how migrants’ identities adjust to current political debates, while the effect of group-centered issue appeals on political attitudes have been primarily studied in the US.","Political science","Humanities and Social Sciences;Sociology, social work, political sciences, media and communication studies, health","Institut für Politikwissenschaft Universität Zürich","Switzerland","University of Zurich - ZH","Project funding (Div.

Une analyse socio-historique","Mattmark; Histoire de la migration; Histoire Suisse; Sécurité au travail; Politiques publiques","Le 30 août 1965, un pan du Glacier de l'Allalin s'effondre sur le chantier d’excavation du barrage de Mattmark situé en haut de la vallée de Saas dans le canton du Valais. Cette catastrophe marque durablement l’histoire migratoire récente de la Suisse. Pour la première fois, des migrants meurent sur leur lieu de travail aux côtés de travailleurs suisses. Sur 88 disparus, on dénombre 56 Italiens, 23 Suisses, 4 Espagnols, 2 Allemands, 2 Autrichiens et 1 apatride. Par la diversité d’origine des victimes, cet événement acquiert une dimension internationale. Il suscite en Suisse et en Europe un débat sur les conditions humaines des migrations économiques et sur les conditions d’exercice professionnel des migrants. En Suisse même, au-delà de la polémique publique à propos des erreurs de gestion commises sur le chantier, les victimes immigrées de Mattmark acquièrent un statut d’être humain soulevant compassion et méritant réparation. Au vu des risques encourus pour construire la Suisse moderne, le travailleur immigré fait alors l’objet de sollicitudes ; en témoignent les nombreuses actions de solidarités engagées après Mattmark par les organisations syndicales et caritatives.Le débat autour de la catastrophe, le procès qui s’ensuit, les revendications des familles de victime et des autorités italiennes à l’égard des autorités helvétiques suscitent l’opposition des mouvements xénophobes naissants. Non seulement ces revendications sont jugées inacceptables sur le fond, mais elles sont considérées comme un outrage à la politique suisse en faveur de l’immigration étrangère. De fait, la catastrophe de Mattmark débouche sur un double mouvement contradictoire de compassion et de rejet du travailleur immigré.Au niveau médiatique, les catastrophes d'après-guerre témoignent de l’émergence d’un journalisme critique qui dénonce les défaillances des politiques publiques. À Mattmark, le direct télévisé et la présence ininterrompue des journalistes sur place, durant des semaines, mobilisent l’opinion publique sur les conditions de vie des travailleurs immigrés en Suisse et sur les risques d’une exploitation abusive des ressources humaines et naturelles.Au niveau de l’organisation du chantier, Mattmark redéfinit les politiques de sécurité sur les grands équipements et les infrastructures territoriales. Mattmark est devenu en ce domaine un modèle. L’engagement d’une réflexion sur la protection civile, à partir de l’institutionnalisation d’un corps permanent d’intervention en cas de catastrophes, doit beaucoup à cette tragédie.À travers ces quatre thèmes (le social, le politique, le médiatique et la sécurité au travail), l’objectif de la recherche est double : premièrement, réévaluer la place de cette catastrophe dans l’histoire de la construction de la Suisse moderne et de son Etat social et, deuxièmement, participer, à l’occasion de la commémoration du cinquantenaire, à la restitution de la mémoire des faits en dépassant la simple chronique des événements. En étudiant l’événement selon une perspective socio-historique - c'est-à-dire en traitant de manière la plus exhaustive possible les archives de Mattmark et en les associant aux problématiques de la migration, de la sécurité et des politiques publiques - le projet vise à donner à cet événement une place centrale dans l’histoire de la Suisse contemporaine.","Swiss history","Humanities and Social Sciences;Theology & religious studies, history, classical studies, archaeology, prehistory and early history","Département de Sociologie Faculté des Sciences de la Société Université de Genève","Switzerland","University of Geneva - GE","Project funding (Div.

Exploring the Physical in Performing Arts Practices","Physical Theater; Inclusion; Disability Studies; Artistic Research; Videoethnography; Performer Training","'Disabled Theater', a production by Zurich theater company Hora (hora.ch), was directed by Jérôme Bel in 2012 and involved a cast of professional actors who have cognitive disabilities; it attracted worldwide attention. The production put Swiss theater practices with professional disabled actors at the heart of the ongoing international debate around disability arts. Nevertheless, although there are a variety of Swiss theater and dance companies working with disabled performers, there is little or no critical discourse about disability arts within the Swiss Arts schools and universities. There is a, then, notable dichotomy between the international reputation of exemplary practical engagement and the almost total absence of any systematically developed theoretical and methodological approach. It is to this absence that 'DisAbility On Stage' is addressed. The project investigates the impact of disabled performers in contemporary theater as a subject of academic and societal relevance. It comprises three central enquiries - performing methods, performing practice, and theoretical reflection - and uses both qualitative and quantitative methods as well as approaches from historiography, theater studies, and ethnography. We also aim to include the three major Swiss language regions. The two subprojects are as follows:Subproject 1: Disabled Bodies in Discourse This subproject analyses how disability is reflected in art criticism (1b) and in acting methods, expecially in Physical Theater practices (1a). The first study on 'The Disabled Body in Physical Theatre Methods' takes a historiographical perspective on the paradoxical relation between disability performance and physical theater. When, why and where are disabled performers excluded from the physical theater discourse, despite having developed their own space as a theater form of non-verbal and bodily expression? This study will be lead by Scuola Theatro Dimitri in Verscio.The second study focuses on the discourse about disabled performers that is led by professional art critics and theater/dance experts. In this subproject, we will take the large amount of publicity generated by and for the Swiss theater company Theater Hora as our starting point and proceed by investigating the reception of the integrative theater and dance festivals in Switzerland. Critically examining the current standards of experts’ discourse, this subproject investigates the question: have recent developments led to a paradigm shift and greater awareness of disabled performers in Switzerland? This Ph.D project is based at University of Bern. Subproject 2: Body Techniques and Aesthetics in Performing PracticesThe second subproject dissects rehearsal processes and communication systems among (dis-)abled performers and directors/choreographers with cognitive disabilities. It aims to create a new methodology and non text-based vocabulary by combining practice-based research approaches and video-ethnography methods. How do video-based methods open up new prosibilities for the documentation and descriptiveness of performing and rehearsal processes, esp. in terms of disabled performers who do often use their body and not text as their primary means of communication? The long-term performance project 'Five Obstructions' by the Swiss theater company Theater Hora will be the focus of this empirical study. In 'Five Obstructions', members of the Hora ensemble are working as directors/choreographers in collaboration with non-disabled artists. This subproject will be undertaken by the Zurich University of the Arts and the University of Basel, in collaboration with various national and international partners and festivals.Our overall aim is to address both expert audiences and a wider public. 'DisAbility On Stage' brings together a unique team with members from national and international universities, art schools, and dance/theater compa-nies. It includes close collaborations with theater/dance festivals and Migros Culture Percentage/IntegrART. Crucially, the project opens up a new research area in the German-speaking scientific and practitioner community. By questioning different levels of assumptions about disabled performers’ abilities (as well as dis-abilities of non-disabled performers), exposing their performances and training methods to preeminent aesthetic categories, we aim to offer a study on disability performance that is not separated from, but occurs within contemporary performing methods, practices, and theories.","Music, Theatre","Humanities and Social Sciences;Art studies, musicology, theatre and film studies, architecture","Medien & Kunst Zürcher Hochschule der Künste","Switzerland","Zurich University of the Arts - ZHdK","Project funding (Div.

Against the backdrop of artistic landmarks since the 1950s such as Pina Bausch's Kontaktof (1978) we trace a development of performance art as a means of resistance against the disciplining standardisation and elimination of deviant bodyminds from the public sphere. After the horrific annihilation of non normative subjects in Nazi Germany Bausch's concept of dance can be understood as a counter force that opened up the stage for bodies which do not comply with a tradition of youth and perfection. This approach perpetuated a desire for the aesthetics offered up by the disabled body.    With increasingly more disabled performers taking centre stage in the last 40 years worldwide contemporary dance and theatre has evolved. Ensembles of artists with intellectual disability such as Australian Back to Back and Swiss Theater HORA as well as disabled solo artists including Dan Daw Claire Cunningham and Michael Turinsky have developed unique performative styles and travel internationally to present their work. These artists follow a tradition of art as a means of resistance. In the context of theatre work's growing internationalisation this resistive potential itself seems to be endangered.     The international flow of ideas and aesthetic concepts and the travelling of disabled artists demands flexibility self sufficiency and mobility all keywords deeply connected to a neoliberal idea of being human that contains a threat to non normative bodyminds. At the same time international recognition and exchange enables societal inclusion of disabled artists and disabled people more widely. Thus from a disability performance perspective internationalisation reveals the current state of theatre as an ambivalent ongoing process. In our chapter we explore exemplary artistic work which constitutes this process.  ","Media relations: print media, online media",": DisAbility on Stage.

Nicht zuletzt würden sie als „ethnische Grenzen“ mitten durch die städtischen Nachbarschaften verlaufen, was uns vor ein fundamentales Problem unserer Demokratien stelle: In europäischen Städten besteht ein wachsender Schiismus zwischen der de jure auf nationaler Bürgerschaft aufbauenden Demokratie und den de facto postnationalen Bevölkerungen in den Städten (Varsanyi 2006). So haben die Verschiebungen und Grenzziehungen, die durch die Prozesse der Globalisierung und der globalen Migration entstanden sind, zu einer laufenden Debatte um postnationale Bürgerschaft geführt (Isin & Turner 2007). Städte sind bereits Räume von postnationalen Gesellschaften, die eine Globalisierung und Kosmopolitisierung des städtischen Alltagslebens antreiben (Yildiz 2013). Gleichzeitig verstärkt die Neoliberalisierung städtischer Politik (Ronneberger 2005) aber auch die ausschliessenden und Ungleichheit produzierenden Prozesse sozialräumlicher Stratifizierung (Sassen 2001). Das Forschungsprojekt will einen kulturwissenschaftlichen Beitrag zur Debatte um postnationale Bürgerschaft leisten, indem es untersucht, wie Formen städtischer und alltagskultureller Raumproduktion an der Veränderung politischer Teilhabe in migrantisch geprägten Gesellschaften beteiligt sind. Dies soll Rückschlüsse darauf ermöglichen, wie sich Bürgerschaft neu denken liesse, um den von Diversität geprägten Städten gerecht zu werden.Beantragt wird eine Dissertation, die anhand von aktuellen Stadtentwicklungsprozessen in Basel und Brüssel die Verhandlung sozialräumlicher und politischer Teilhabe in europäischen Städten untersucht. In beiden Städten lässt sich im Jahr 2007 ein Bruch in der städtischen Politik beobachten, der auf eine verstärkte Neoliberalisierung der Stadtpolitik verweist. Die Positionierung von Basel als Standort für die Life-Science-Industrie und von Brüssel als Hauptsitz der europäischen Institutionen, die Attraktion hochqualifizierter MigrantInnen, sowie umkämpfte Waterfront-Developments in migrantisch geprägten ‚Problemvierteln’ führen zu mehrschichtigen Verschiebungen bürgerschaftlicher Teilhabe, die dieses Projekt untersuchen will. Es wird danach gefragt, inwiefern durch die Produktion von urbanem Raum grundlegende politische Prozesse der Teilhabe wirkmächtig werden und wie diese Formen der Teilhabe gleichzeitig durch die alltagsweltlichen Raumaneignungen reproduziert, aber auch transformiert werden. Dabei wird einerseits mit diskursanalytischen und kartographischen Methoden sowie der ethnographischen Beobachtung und Analyse von umstrittenen öffentlichen Räumen nach der Materialisierung städtischer Politiken und den Praktiken der Raumverhandlungen gefragt. Andererseits werden mit Hilfe von teilnehmender Beobachtung und qualitativen Interviews „acts of citizenship“ (Isin 2000) im ‚kosmopolitischen Alltag’ untersucht.Das Forschungsvorhaben positioniert sich im interdisziplinären Feld zwischen Migrations-, Stadt- und Citizenship-Forschung mit Fokus auf kulturwissenschaftliche Ansätze. Die Forschung soll durch eine vergleichende Analyse der Städte Basel und Brüssel ein Verständnis für verschiedene und vergleichbare europäische Formen der Raumverhandlungen und politischer Teilhabe ermöglichen. Sie verortet sich im „spatial turn“ der Gesellschaftswissenschaften, und sucht nach Rückschlüssen auf aktuelle Diskussionen um Raum: Wie kann Raum theoretisch so gefasst und analysiert werden, dass er gleichzeitig als strukturierendes und strukturveränderndes Element verstanden werden kann?
